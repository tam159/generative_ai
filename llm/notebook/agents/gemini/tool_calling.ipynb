       "AIMessage(content=\"The sky appears blue to the human eye because of a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering. This scattering occurs when sunlight enters the Earth's atmosphere and interacts with air molecules, water droplets, and tiny particles. Sunlight, or white light, is made up of a spectrum of colors that can be seen in a rainbow. Each color has a different wavelength, with blue light having shorter, smaller waves.\\n\\nWhen sunlight encounters the molecules and particles in the Earth's atmosphere, the shorter wavelengths of light (blue and violet) are scattered in all directions by these molecules and particles more than the other colors in the spectrum. While violet light is also scattered, our eyes are more sensitive to blue light, and the upper atmosphere absorbs violet light, making the sky appear predominantly blue to us.\\n\\nThe scattering of shorter wavelengths of light more than the longer wavelengths (like red and orange) is due to the sizes of the atmospheric particles being closer to the wavelength of blue light. This selective scattering of light by particle size is why the sky is blue during the day when the sun is high in the sky.\\n\\nAt sunrise and sunset, the sky can appear red or orange because the sun's light is passing through a thicker layer of the atmosphere, scattering out even more of the shorter wavelengths and allowing the longer wavelengths (reds and oranges) to reach our eyes.\", response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 267, 'prompt_tokens': 13, 'total_tokens': 280}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4-turbo-preview', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_122114e45f', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, id='run-d0a72321-477e-41e4-bf81-c21b01ebc0b7-0')"

      "1. **Gradually Adjust Your Schedule**: Start by setting your alarm just 15 minutes earlier than usual and gradually adjust it earlier in small increments until you reach your desired wake-up time.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Create a Sleep Schedule**: Go to bed and wake up at the same time every day, even on weekends. Consistency is key to adjusting your body's internal clock.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Improve Your Sleep Environment**: Make sure your bedroom is conducive to sleep. It should be quiet, dark, and at a comfortable temperature. Consider using blackout curtains, earplugs, or white noise machines if necessary.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Limit Exposure to Screens**: The blue light emitted by phones, tablets, and computers can interfere with your ability to fall asleep. Try to avoid screens for at least an hour before bed.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Develop a Bedtime Routine**: Establish a relaxing routine before bed to signal to your body that it's time to wind down. This could include activities like reading, taking a warm bath, or meditating.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Avoid Stimulants**: Limit caffeine and nicotine, especially in the hours leading up to bedtime, as they can make it harder to fall asleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Use Natural Light**: Exposure to natural light during the day can help regulate your body's sleep-wake cycle. Try to spend some time outside every day and open curtains or blinds as soon as you wake up.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Exercise Regularly**: Regular physical activity can help you fall asleep faster and enjoy deeper sleep. However, try not to exercise too close to bedtime, as it can energize you and make it harder to fall asleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. **Be Mindful of Eating and Drinking**: Avoid large meals, caffeine, and alcohol before bedtime, as they can disrupt sleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "10. **Motivate Yourself**: Give yourself a good reason to get up early, whether it's a personal project, exercise, or simply having some quiet time to yourself.\n",
      "\n",
      "11. **Use an Alarm Clock Wisely**: Place your alarm clock across the room to force yourself to get up to turn it off. Consider using an alarm that simulates sunrise or plays pleasant but energizing music.\n",
      "\n",
      "12. **Be Patient and Persistent**: It may take some time for your body to adjust to a new schedule. Be patient with yourself and stick with your routine, even if you don't always succeed in waking up early.\n",
