       "\"I've created an 8-week training plan for your half marathon preparation. The plan gradually increases your mileage while incorporating different types of runs and adequate rest periods. Here's a breakdown of the key components:\\n\\n1. Weekly Structure:\\n- 3-4 running days\\n- 2 rest/cross-training days\\n- 1 long run day (typically Saturday)\\n- 1 complete rest or active recovery day (Sunday)\\n\\n2. Types of Runs:\\n- Easy runs: Build base endurance\\n- Interval training: Improve speed and running economy\\n- Long runs: Build endurance and prepare for race distance\\n- Tempo runs: Improve running efficiency\\n\\n3. Progressive Build-up:\\n- Weeks 1-2: Building base mileage\\n- Weeks 3-4: Increasing distance\\n- Weeks 5-6: Peak training weeks\\n- Week 7: Maximum long run\\n- Week 8: Taper week for race preparation\\n\\nThe plan assumes you can already run 3-4 miles comfortably. If this isn't the case, please let me know, and I can adjust the plan accordingly. Also, if you have any specific concerns or constraints (like previous injuries or schedule limitations), I can modify the plan to better suit your needs.\\n\\nWould you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of the training plan?\""
