    "# How to do function calling with the Converse API \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how we can improve model capability by using the Converse or ConverseStream API with external functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Converse and ConverseStream provide a unified structured text action for simplifying the invocations to Bedrock LLMs. It includes the possibility to define tools for implementing external functions that can be called or triggered from the LLMs.\n",
    "\n",
    "As part of these APIs, the `toolConfig` parameter takes a list of `tools` in JSON schema. Each tool is defined as a `ToolSpec`, which includes its name, description and input schema. The model can be forced to call a given tool by supplying `toolChoice` within `toolConfig` with `{\"tool\": {\"name\": <some_tool_name>}}`. Each tool receives a unique identifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the model chooses to call a tool, the response contains a `toolUse` object. It includes the tool's identifier, name and the input parameters supplied by the model. The model will also set the `stopReason` response field to `tool_use`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "- **Basic tool definition and function calling** We define a single tool for simulating a weather forecast lookup tool (`get_weather`) and allow the model to call this tool.\n",
    "- **Supplying the model with multiple tools to choose from** Starting from the previous example, we add a tool to search the web (`web_search`) and give the the model the liberty to decide the tool that is best fit for a given request.\n",
    "- **Letting the model call multiple tools in a single turn** We modify the conversation flow to support parallel function calling. Then, we present an example where the model needs to call multiple tools in succession.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to learn more details about the parameters supported in the Bedrock Converse API, read the [api reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/APIReference/API_runtime_Converse.html) and [user guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/conversation-inference.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic tool definition and function-calling\n",
    "\n",
    "We set our tools through Python functions and start by defining a tool for simulating a weather forecast lookup tool (`get_weather`). Note in our example we're just returning a constant weather forecast to illustrate the concept, but you could make it fully functional by connecting any weather service API. Later in the example, we call the Open-Meteo API."
