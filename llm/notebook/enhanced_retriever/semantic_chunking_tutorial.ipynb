   "source": "LLMs are bound to hallucinate and then we have different strategies to mitigate this hallucination behaviour of LLMs. One such strategy is Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), where a knowledge base is already augmented/provided to the LLM to retrieve the information from and this way LLMs won't hallucinate since the knowledge base is already specified. \n\nRAG involves a step by step process of loading the documents/data, splitting the documents into chunks using any AI framework such as LangChain or LlamaIndex, and vector embeddings generation for the data and storing these embeddings in a vector database.\n\nSo, broadly we can devide the RAG into two main parts, Storing and Retrieval.\n\nWhile enahncing our RAG pipeline, one thing we need to looak at is the retriavl strategy and technoques involved.\nWe can improve retrieval in RAG using the proper chunking strategy. But finding the right chunk size for any given text is a very hard question in general.\n\nToday, we will see how semantic chunking works.\n\nSemantic Chunking considers the relationships within the text. It divides the text into meaningful, semantically complete chunks. This approach ensures the information’s integrity during retrieval, leading to a more accurate and contextually appropriate outcome.\n\nLet's experiment with Semantic chunking & see the results"

      "\n",
      "We introduce a new language representa- tion model called BERT, which stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. Unlike recent language repre- sentation models (Peters et al., 2018a; Rad- ford et al., 2018), BERT is designed to pre- train deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers. As a re- sult, the pre-trained BERT model can be ﬁne- tuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks, such as question answering and language inference, without substantial task- speciﬁc architecture modiﬁcations.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are two existing strategies for apply- ing pre-trained language representations to down- stream tasks: feature-based and ﬁne-tuning. The feature-based approach, such as ELMo (Peters et al., 2018a), uses task-speciﬁc architectures that include the pre-trained representations as addi- tional features. The ﬁne-tuning approach, such as the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (OpenAI GPT) (Radford et al., 2018), introduces minimal task-speciﬁc parameters, and is trained on the downstream tasks by simply ﬁne-tuning all pre- trained parameters. The two approaches share the same objective function during pre-training, where they use unidirectional language models to learn general language representations.\n",
      "\n",
      "BERT is conceptually simple and empirically powerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art re- sults on eleven natural language processing tasks, including pushing the GLUE score to 80.5% (7.7% point absolute improvement), MultiNLI accuracy to 86.7% (4.6% absolute improvement), SQuAD v1.1 question answer- ing Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute im- provement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1 (5.1 point absolute improvement).\n",

      "Introduction\n",
      "\n",
      "Language model pre-training has been shown to be effective for improving many natural language processing tasks (Dai and Le, 2015; Peters et al., 2018a; Radford et al., 2018; Howard and Ruder, 2018). These include sentence-level tasks such as natural language inference (Bowman et al., 2015; Williams et al., 2018) and paraphrasing (Dolan and Brockett, 2005), which aim to predict the re- lationships between sentences by analyzing them holistically, as well as token-level tasks such as named entity recognition and question answering, where models are required to produce ﬁne-grained output at the token level (Tjong Kim Sang and De Meulder, 2003; Rajpurkar et al., 2016).\n",
      "\n",
      "We argue that current techniques restrict the power of the pre-trained representations, espe- cially for the ﬁne-tuning approaches. The ma- jor limitation is that standard language models are unidirectional, and this limits the choice of archi- tectures that can be used during pre-training. For example, in OpenAI GPT, the authors use a left-to- right architecture, where every token can only at- tend to previous tokens in the self-attention layers of the Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017). Such re- strictions are sub-optimal for sentence-level tasks, and could be very harmful when applying ﬁne- tuning based approaches to token-level tasks such as question answering, where it is crucial to incor- porate context from both directions.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this paper, we improve the ﬁne-tuning based approaches by proposing BERT: Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. BERT alleviates the previously mentioned unidi- rectionality constraint by using a “masked lan- guage model” (MLM) pre-training objective, in- spired by the Cloze task (Taylor, 1953). The masked language model randomly masks some of the tokens from the input, and the objective is to predict the original vocabulary id of the masked\n",
      "\n",
      "word based only on its context. Unlike left-to- right language model pre-training, the MLM ob- jective enables the representation to fuse the left and the right context, which allows us to pre- In addi- train a deep bidirectional Transformer. tion to the masked language model, we also use a “next sentence prediction” task that jointly pre- trains text-pair representations.

      "We demonstrate the importance of bidirectional pre-training for language representations. Un- like Radford et al. (2018), which uses unidirec- tional language models for pre-training, BERT uses masked language models to enable pre- trained deep bidirectional representations. This is also in contrast to Peters et al. (2018a), which uses a shallow concatenation of independently trained left-to-right and right-to-left LMs.\n",

      "We show that pre-trained representations reduce the need for many heavily-engineered task- speciﬁc architectures. BERT is the ﬁrst ﬁne- tuning based representation model that achieves state-of-the-art performance on a large suite of sentence-level and token-level tasks, outper- forming many task-speciﬁc architectures.\n",

      "Learning widely applicable representations of words has been an active area of research for decades, including non-neural (Brown et al., 1992; Ando and Zhang, 2005; Blitzer et al., 2006) and neural (Mikolov et al., 2013; Pennington et al., 2014) methods. Pre-trained word embeddings are an integral part of modern NLP systems, of- fering signiﬁcant improvements over embeddings learned from scratch (Turian et al., 2010). To pre- train word embedding vectors, left-to-right lan- guage modeling objectives have been used (Mnih and Hinton, 2009), as well as objectives to dis- criminate correct from incorrect words in left and right context (Mikolov et al., 2013).\n",
      "\n",
      "These approaches have been generalized to coarser granularities, such as sentence embed- dings (Kiros et al., 2015; Logeswaran and Lee, 2018) or paragraph embeddings (Le and Mikolov, 2014). To train sentence representations, prior work has used objectives to rank candidate next sentences (Jernite et al., 2017; Logeswaran and Lee, 2018), left-to-right generation of next sen- tence words given a representation of the previous sentence (Kiros et al., 2015), or denoising auto- encoder derived objectives (Hill et al., 2016).\n",
      "\n",
      "ELMo and its predecessor (Peters et al., 2017, 2018a) generalize traditional word embedding re- search along a different dimension. They extract context-sensitive features from a left-to-right and a right-to-left language model. The contextual rep- resentation of each token is the concatenation of the left-to-right and right-to-left representations. When integrating contextual word embeddings with existing task-speciﬁc architectures, ELMo advances the state of the art for several major NLP benchmarks (Peters et al., 2018a) including ques- tion answering (Rajpurkar et al., 2016), sentiment analysis (Socher et al., 2013), and named entity recognition (Tjong Kim Sang and De Meulder, 2003). Melamud et al. (2016) proposed learning contextual representations through a task to pre- dict a single word from both left and right context using LSTMs. Similar to ELMo, their model is feature-based and not deeply bidirectional. Fedus et al. (2018) shows that the cloze task can be used to improve the robustness of text generation mod- els.\n",

      "More recently, sentence or document encoders which produce contextual token representations have been pre-trained from unlabeled text and ﬁne-tuned for a supervised downstream task (Dai and Le, 2015; Howard and Ruder, 2018; Radford et al., 2018). The advantage of these approaches is that few parameters need to be learned from scratch. At least partly due to this advantage, OpenAI GPT (Radford et al., 2018) achieved pre- viously state-of-the-art results on many sentence- level tasks from the GLUE benchmark (Wang language model- Left-to-right et al., 2018a).\n",

Throughout this work, a “sentence” can be an arbi- trary span of contiguous text, rather than an actual linguistic sentence. A “sequence” refers to the in- put token sequence to BERT, which may be a sin- gle sentence or two sentences packed together.\n",
      "\n",
      "We use WordPiece embeddings (Wu et al., 2016) with a 30,000 token vocabulary. The ﬁrst token of every sequence is always a special clas- siﬁcation token ([CLS]). The ﬁnal hidden state corresponding to this token is used as the ag- gregate sequence representation for classiﬁcation tasks. Sentence pairs are packed together into a single sequence. We differentiate the sentences in two ways. First, we separate them with a special token ([SEP]). Second, we add a learned embed- ding to every token indicating whether it belongs to sentence A or sentence B. As shown in Figure 1, we denote input embedding as E, the ﬁnal hidden vector of the special [CLS] token as C ∈ RH , and the ﬁnal hidden vector for the ith input token as Ti ∈ RH .\n",

      "Unlike Peters et al. (2018a) and Radford et al. (2018), we do not use traditional left-to-right or right-to-left language models to pre-train BERT. Instead, we pre-train BERT using two unsuper- vised tasks, described in this section. This step is presented in the left part of Figure 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "Task #1: Masked LM Intuitively, it is reason- able to believe that a deep bidirectional model is strictly more powerful than either a left-to-right model or the shallow concatenation of a left-to- right and a right-to-left model. Unfortunately, standard conditional language models can only be trained left-to-right or right-to-left, since bidirec- tional conditioning would allow each word to in- directly “see itself”, and the model could trivially predict the target word in a multi-layered context.\n",
      "\n",
      "former is often referred to as a “Transformer encoder” while the left-context-only version is referred to as a “Transformer decoder” since it can be used for text generation.\n",
      "\n",
      "In order to train a deep bidirectional representa- tion, we simply mask some percentage of the input tokens at random, and then predict those masked tokens. We refer to this procedure as a “masked LM” (MLM), although it is often referred to as a Cloze task in the literature (Taylor, 1953). In this case, the ﬁnal hidden vectors corresponding to the mask tokens are fed into an output softmax over the vocabulary, as in a standard LM. In all of our experiments, we mask 15% of all WordPiece to- kens in each sequence at random. In contrast to denoising auto-encoders (Vincent et al., 2008), we only predict the masked words rather than recon- structing the entire input.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although this allows us to obtain a bidirec- tional pre-trained model, a downside is that we are creating a mismatch between pre-training and ﬁne-tuning, since the [MASK] token does not ap- pear during ﬁne-tuning. To mitigate this, we do not always replace “masked” words with the ac- tual [MASK] token. The training data generator chooses 15% of the token positions at random for prediction. If the i-th token is chosen, we replace the i-th token with (1) the [MASK] token 80% of the time (2) a random token 10% of the time (3) the unchanged i-th token 10% of the time. Then, Ti will be used to predict the original token with cross entropy loss. We compare variations of this procedure in Appendix C.2.\n",

In order to train a model that understands sentence rela- tionships, we pre-train for a binarized next sen- tence prediction task that can be trivially gener- ated from any monolingual corpus. Speciﬁcally, when choosing the sentences A and B for each pre- training example, 50% of the time B is the actual next sentence that follows A (labeled as IsNext), and 50% of the time it is a random sentence from the corpus (labeled as NotNext). As we show in Figure 1, C is used for next sentence predic- tion (NSP).5 Despite its simplicity, we demon- strate in Section 5.1 that pre-training towards this task is very beneﬁcial to both QA and NLI. 6\n",

      "\n",
      "No NSP: A bidirectional model which is trained using the “masked LM” (MLM) but without the “next sentence prediction” (NSP) task. LTR & No NSP: A left-context-only model which is trained using a standard Left-to-Right (LTR) LM, rather than an MLM. The left-only constraint was also applied at ﬁne-tuning, because removing it introduced a pre-train/ﬁne-tune mismatch that degraded downstream performance. Additionally, this model was pre-trained without the NSP task. This is directly comparable to OpenAI GPT, but using our larger training dataset, our input repre- sentation, and our ﬁne-tuning scheme.\n",
      "\n",
      "We ﬁrst examine the impact brought by the NSP In Table 5, we show that removing NSP task. hurts performance signiﬁcantly on QNLI, MNLI, and SQuAD 1.1. Next, we evaluate the impact of training bidirectional representations by com- paring “No NSP” to “LTR & No NSP”. The LTR model performs worse than the MLM model on all tasks, with large drops on MRPC and SQuAD.\n",
      "\n",
      "For SQuAD it is intuitively clear that a LTR model will perform poorly at token predictions, since the token-level hidden states have no right- side context. In order to make a good faith at- tempt at strengthening the LTR system, we added a randomly initialized BiLSTM on top. This does signiﬁcantly improve results on SQuAD, but the\n",
      "\n",
      "results are still far worse than those of the pre- trained bidirectional models. The BiLSTM hurts performance on the GLUE tasks.\n",
      "\n",
      "We recognize that it would also be possible to train separate LTR and RTL models and represent each token as the concatenation of the two mod- els, as ELMo does. However: (a) this is twice as expensive as a single bidirectional model; (b) this is non-intuitive for tasks like QA, since the RTL model would not be able to condition the answer on the question; (c) this it is strictly less powerful than a deep bidirectional model, since it can use both left and right context at every layer.\n",

      "5.2 Effect of Model Size\n",
      "\n",
      "In this section, we explore the effect of model size on ﬁne-tuning task accuracy. We trained a number of BERT models with a differing number of layers, hidden units, and attention heads, while otherwise using the same hyperparameters and training pro- cedure as described previously.\n",
      "\n",
      "Results on selected GLUE tasks are shown in Table 6. In this table, we report the average Dev Set accuracy from 5 random restarts of ﬁne-tuning. We can see that larger models lead to a strict ac- curacy improvement across all four datasets, even for MRPC which only has 3,600 labeled train- ing examples, and is substantially different from the pre-training tasks. It is also perhaps surpris- ing that we are able to achieve such signiﬁcant improvements on top of models which are al- ready quite large relative to the existing literature. For example, the largest Transformer explored in Vaswani et al. (2017) is (L=6, H=1024, A=16) with 100M parameters for the encoder, and the largest Transformer we have found in the literature is (L=64, H=512, A=2) with 235M parameters (Al-Rfou et al., 2018). By contrast, BERTBASE contains 110M parameters and BERTLARGE con- tains 340M parameters.\n",
      "\n",
      "It has long been known that increasing the model size will lead to continual improvements on large-scale tasks such as machine translation and language modeling, which is demonstrated by the LM perplexity of held-out training data shown in Table 6. However, we believe that this is the ﬁrst work to demonstrate convinc- ingly that scaling to extreme model sizes also leads to large improvements on very small scale tasks, provided that the model has been sufﬁ- ciently pre-trained. Peters et al. (2018b) presented\n",
      "\n",
      "mixed results on the downstream task impact of increasing the pre-trained bi-LM size from two to four layers and Melamud et al. (2016) men- tioned in passing that increasing hidden dimen- sion size from 200 to 600 helped, but increasing further to 1,000 did not bring further improve- ments. Both of these prior works used a feature- based approach — we hypothesize that when the model is ﬁne-tuned directly on the downstream tasks and uses only a very small number of ran- domly initialized additional parameters, the task- speciﬁc models can beneﬁt from the larger, more expressive pre-trained representations even when downstream task data is very small.\n",
      "\n",
      "5.3 Feature-based Approach with BERT\n",
      "\n",
      "All of the BERT results presented so far have used the ﬁne-tuning approach, where a simple classiﬁ- cation layer is added to the pre-trained model, and all parameters are jointly ﬁne-tuned on a down- stream task. However, the feature-based approach, where ﬁxed features are extracted from the pre- trained model, has certain advantages. First, not all tasks can be easily represented by a Trans- former encoder architecture, and therefore require a task-speciﬁc model architecture to be added. Second, there are major computational beneﬁts to pre-compute an expensive representation of the training data once and then run many experiments with cheaper models on top of this representation. In this section, we compare the two approaches by applying BERT to the CoNLL-2003 Named Entity Recognition (NER) task (Tjong Kim Sang and De Meulder, 2003). In the input to BERT, we use a case-preserving WordPiece model, and we include the maximal document context provided by the data. Following standard practice, we for- mulate this as a tagging task but do not use a CRF\n",

In Section C.2, we evaluate the impact this proce- dure.\n",

The ﬁrst sentence receives the A embedding and the second receives the B embed- ding. 50% of the time B is the actual next sentence that follows A and 50% of the time it is a random sentence, which is done for the “next sentence pre- diction” task. They are sampled such that the com- bined length is ≤ 512 tokens. The LM masking is applied after WordPiece tokenization with a uni- form masking rate of 15%, and no special consid- eration given to partial word pieces.\n",
      "\n",
      "Longer sequences are disproportionately expen- sive because attention is quadratic to the sequence length. To speed up pretraing in our experiments, we pre-train the model with sequence length of 128 for 90% of the steps. Then, we train the rest 10% of the steps of sequence of 512 to learn the positional embeddings.\n",

Fine-tuning is typically very fast, so it is rea- sonable to simply run an exhaustive search over the above parameters and choose the model that performs best on the development set.\n",

Note that in addition to the architec- ture differences, BERT and OpenAI GPT are ﬁne- tuning approaches, while ELMo is a feature-based approach.\n",
      "\n",
      "The most comparable existing pre-training method to BERT is OpenAI GPT, which trains a left-to-right Transformer LM on a large text cor- pus. In fact, many of the design decisions in BERT were intentionally made to make it as close to GPT as possible so that the two methods could be minimally compared. The core argument of this work is that the bi-directionality and the two pre- training tasks presented in Section 3.1 account for the majority of the empirical improvements, but we do note that there are several other differences between how BERT and GPT were trained:\n",
      "\n",
      "GPT is trained on the BooksCorpus (800M words); BERT is trained on the BooksCor- pus (800M words) and Wikipedia (2,500M words).\n",
      "\n",
      "GPT uses a sentence separator ([SEP]) and classiﬁer token ([CLS]) which are only in- troduced at ﬁne-tuning time; BERT learns [SEP], [CLS] and sentence A/B embed- dings during pre-training.\n",
      "\n",
      "GPT was trained for 1M steps with a batch size of 32,000 words; BERT was trained for 1M steps with a batch size of 128,000 words.\n",
      "\n",
      "GPT used the same learning rate of 5e-5 for all ﬁne-tuning experiments; BERT chooses a task-speciﬁc ﬁne-tuning learning rate which performs the best on the development set.\n",
      "\n",
      "To isolate the effect of these differences, we per- form ablation experiments in Section 5.1 which demonstrate that the majority of the improvements are in fact coming from the two pre-training tasks and the bidirectionality they enable.\n",

      "The illustration of ﬁne-tuning BERT on different tasks can be seen in Figure 4. Our task-speciﬁc models are formed by incorporating BERT with one additional output layer, so a minimal num- ber of parameters need to be learned from scratch. Among the tasks, (a) and (b) are sequence-level tasks while (c) and (d) are token-level tasks. In the ﬁgure, E represents the input embedding, Ti represents the contextual representation of token i, [CLS] is the special symbol for classiﬁcation out- put, and [SEP] is the special symbol to separate non-consecutive token sequences.\n",

This approach performs competitively with state-of-the-art methods, achieving results only 0.3 F1 behind fine-tuning the entire model.\\n\\n5. This demonstrates that BERT is effective for both fine-tuning and feature-based approaches.\\n\\nThe feature-based approach is contrasted with the fine-tuning approach, where all parameters of the pre-trained model are jointly fine-tuned on a downstream task.
