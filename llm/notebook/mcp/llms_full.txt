Conceptual Guide¶
This guide provides explanations of the key concepts behind the LangGraph framework and AI applications more broadly.
We recommend that you go through at least the Quickstart before diving into the conceptual guide. This will provide practical context that will make it easier to understand the concepts discussed here.
The conceptual guide does not cover step-by-step instructions or specific implementation examples — those are found in the Tutorials and How-to guides. For detailed reference material, please see the API reference.
LangGraph¶
High Level¶

Why LangGraph?: A high-level overview of LangGraph and its goals.

Concepts¶

LangGraph Glossary: LangGraph workflows are designed as graphs, with nodes representing different components and edges representing the flow of information between them. This guide provides an overview of the key concepts associated with LangGraph graph primitives.
Common Agentic Patterns: An agent uses an LLM to pick its own control flow to solve more complex problems! Agents are a key building block in many LLM applications. This guide explains the different types of agent architectures and how they can be used to control the flow of an application.
Multi-Agent Systems: Complex LLM applications can often be broken down into multiple agents, each responsible for a different part of the application. This guide explains common patterns for building multi-agent systems.
Breakpoints: Breakpoints allow pausing the execution of a graph at specific points. Breakpoints allow stepping through graph execution for debugging purposes.
Human-in-the-Loop: Explains different ways of integrating human feedback into a LangGraph application.
Time Travel: Time travel allows you to replay past actions in your LangGraph application to explore alternative paths and debug issues.
Persistence: LangGraph has a built-in persistence layer, implemented through checkpointers. This persistence layer helps to support powerful capabilities like human-in-the-loop, memory, time travel, and fault-tolerance.
Memory: Memory in AI applications refers to the ability to process, store, and effectively recall information from past interactions. With memory, your agents can learn from feedback and adapt to users' preferences.
Streaming: Streaming is crucial for enhancing the responsiveness of applications built on LLMs. By displaying output progressively, even before a complete response is ready, streaming significantly improves user experience (UX), particularly when dealing with the latency of LLMs.
Functional API: @entrypoint and @task decorators that allow you to add LangGraph functionality to an existing codebase.
Durable Execution: LangGraph's built-in persistence layer provides durable execution for workflows, ensuring that the state of each execution step is saved to a durable store. 
Pregel: Pregel is LangGraph's runtime, which is responsible for managing the execution of LangGraph applications.
FAQ: Frequently asked questions about LangGraph.

LangGraph Platform¶
LangGraph Platform is a commercial solution for deploying agentic applications in production, built on the open-source LangGraph framework.
The LangGraph Platform offers a few different deployment options described in the deployment options guide.

Tip

LangGraph is an MIT-licensed open-source library, which we are committed to maintaining and growing for the community.
You can always deploy LangGraph applications on your own infrastructure using the open-source LangGraph project without using LangGraph Platform.

High Level¶

Why LangGraph Platform?: The LangGraph platform is an opinionated way to deploy and manage LangGraph applications. This guide provides an overview of the key features and concepts behind LangGraph Platform.
Platform Architecture: A high-level overview of the architecture of the LangGraph Platform.
Scalability and Resilience: LangGraph Platform is designed to be scalable and resilient. This document explains how the platform achieves this.
Deployment Options: LangGraph Platform offers four deployment options: Cloud SaaS, Self-Hosted Data Plane, Self-Hosted Control Plane, and Standalone Container. This guide explains the differences between these options, and which Plans they are available on.
Plans: LangGraph Platforms offer three different plans: Developer, Plus, Enterprise. This guide explains the differences between these options, what deployment options are available for each, and how to sign up for each one.
Template Applications: Reference applications designed to help you get started quickly when building with LangGraph.

Components¶
The LangGraph Platform comprises several components that work together to support the deployment and management of LangGraph applications:

LangGraph Server: The LangGraph Server is designed to support a wide range of agentic application use cases, from background processing to real-time interactions.
LangGraph Studio: LangGraph Studio is a specialized IDE that can connect to a LangGraph Server to enable visualization, interaction, and debugging of the application locally.
LangGraph CLI: LangGraph CLI is a command-line interface that helps to interact with a local LangGraph
Python/JS SDK: The Python/JS SDK provides a programmatic way to interact with deployed LangGraph Applications.
Remote Graph: A RemoteGraph allows you to interact with any deployed LangGraph application as though it were running locally.
LangGraph Control Plane: The LangGraph Control Plane refers to the Control Plane UI where users create and update LangGraph Servers and the Control Plane APIs that support the UI experience.
LangGraph Data Plane: The LangGraph Data Plane refers to LangGraph Servers, the corresponding infrastructure for each server, and the "listener" application that continuously polls for updates from the LangGraph Control Plane.

LangGraph Server¶

Application Structure: A LangGraph application consists of one or more graphs, a LangGraph API Configuration file (langgraph.json), a file that specifies dependencies, and environment variables.
Assistants: Assistants are a way to save and manage different configurations of your LangGraph applications.
Web-hooks: Webhooks allow your running LangGraph application to send data to external services on specific events.
Cron Jobs: Cron jobs are a way to schedule tasks to run at specific times in your LangGraph application.
Double Texting: Double texting is a common issue in LLM applications where users may send multiple messages before the graph has finished running. This guide explains how to handle double texting with LangGraph Deploy.
Authentication & Access Control: Learn about options for authentication and access control when deploying the LangGraph Platform.

Deployment Options¶

Cloud SaaS(Beta): Connect to your GitHub repositories and deploy LangGraph Servers to LangChain's cloud. We manage everything.
Self-Hosted Data Plane(Beta): Create deployments from the Control Plane UI and deploy LangGraph Servers to your cloud. We manage the control plane, you manage the deployments.
Self-Hosted Control Plane(Beta): Create deployments from a self-hosted Control Plane UI and deploy LangGraph Servers to your cloud. You manage everything.
Standalone Container: Deploy LangGraph Server Docker images however you like.

CONTENT:
LangGraph Control Plane¶
The term "control plane" is used broadly to refer to the Control Plane UI where users create and update LangGraph Servers (deployments) and the Control Plane APIs that support the UI experience.
When a user makes an update through the Control Plane UI, the update is stored in the control plane state. The LangGraph Data Plane "listener" application polls for these updates by calling the Control Plane APIs.
Control Plane UI¶
From the Control Plane UI, you can:

View a list of outstanding deployments.
View details of an individual deployment.
Create a new deployment.
Update a deployment.
Update environment variables for a deployment.
View build and server logs of a deployment.
Delete a deployment.

The Control Plane UI is embedded in LangSmith.
Control Plane API¶
This section describes data model of the LangGraph Control Plane API. Control Plane API is used to create, update, and delete deployments. However, they are not publicly accessible.
Deployment¶
A deployment is an instance of a LangGraph Server. A single deployment can have many revisions.
Revision¶
A revision is an iteration of a deployment. When a new deployment is created, an initial revision is automatically created. To deploy code changes or update environment variables for a deployment, a new revision must be created.
Environment Variable¶
Environment variables are set for a deployment. All environment variables are stored as secrets (i.e. saved in a secrets store).
Control Plane Features¶
This section describes various features of the control plane.
Deployment Types¶
For simplicity, the control plane offers two deployment types with different resource allocations: Development and Production.

Deployment Type
CPU
Memory
Scaling

Development
1 CPU
1 GB
Up to 1 container

Production
2 CPU
2 GB
Up to 10 containers

CPU and memory resources are per container.

For Cloud SaaS
For Production type deployments, resources can be manually increased on a case-by-case basis depending on use case and capacity constraints. Contact support@langchain.dev to request an increase in resources.

For Self-Hosted Data Plane and Self-Hosted Control Plane
Resources for Self-Hosted Data Plane and Self-Hosted Control Plane deployments can be fully customized.

Database Provisioning¶
The control plane and LangGraph Data Plane "listener" application coordinate to automatically create a Postgres database for each deployment. The database serves as the persistence layer for the deployment.
When implementing a LangGraph application, a checkpointer does not need to be configured by the developer. Instead, a checkpointer is automatically configured for the graph. Any checkpointer configured for a graph will be replaced by the one that is automatically configured.
There is no direct access to the database. All access to the database occurs through the LangGraph Server.
The database is never deleted until the deployment itself is deleted. See Automatic Deletion for additional details.

For Self-Hosted Data Plane and Self-Hosted Control Plane
A custom Postgres instance can be configured for Self-Hosted Data Plane and Self-Hosted Control Plane deployments.

Asynchronous Deployment¶
Infrastructure for deployments and revisions are provisioned and deployed asynchronously. They are not deployed immediately after submission. Currently, deployment can take up to several minutes.

When a new deployment is created, a new database is created for the deployment. Database creation is a one-time step. This step contributes to a longer deployment time for the initial revision of the deployment.
When a subsequent revision is created for a deployment, there is no database creation step. The deployment time for a subsequent revision is significantly faster compared to the deployment time of the initial revision.
The deployment process for each revision contains a build step, which can take up to a few minutes.

The control plane and LangGraph Data Plane "listener" application coordinate to achieve asynchronous deployments.
Automatic Deletion¶

Only for Cloud SaaS
Automatic deletion of deployments is only available for Cloud SaaS.

The control plane automatically deletes deployments after 28 consecutive days of non-use (it is in an unused state). A deployment is in an unused state if there are no traces emitted to LangSmith from the deployment after 28 consecutive days. On any given day, if a deployment emits a trace to LangSmith, the counter for consecutive days of non-use is reset.

An email notification is sent after 7 consecutive days of non-use.
A deployment is deleted after 28 consecutive days of non-use.

Data Cannot Be Recovered
After a deployment is deleted, the data (e.g. Postgres) from the deployment cannot be recovered.

LangSmith Integration¶
A LangSmith tracing project is automatically created for each deployment. The tracing project has the same name as the deployment. When creating a deployment, the LANGCHAIN_TRACING and LANGSMITH_API_KEY/LANGCHAIN_API_KEY environment variables do not need to be specified; they are set automatically by the control plane.
When a deployment is deleted, the traces and the tracing project are not deleted.

DOCUMENT 3
SOURCE: https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/langgraph_data_plane/
CONTENT:
LangGraph Data Plane¶
The term "data plane" is used broadly to refer to LangGraph Servers (deployments), the corresponding infrastructure for each server, and the "listener" application that continuously polls for updates from the LangGraph Control Plane.
Server Infrastructure¶
In addition to the LangGraph Server itself, the following infrastructure for each server are also included in the broad definition of "data plane":

Postgres
Redis
Secrets store
Autoscalers

See LangGraph Platform Architecture for more details.
"Listener" Application¶
The data plane "listener" application periodically calls Control Plane APIs to:

Determine if new deployments should be created.
Determine if existing deployments should be updated (i.e. new revisions).
Determine if existing deployments should be deleted.

In other words, the data plane "listener" reads the latest state of the control plane (desired state) and takes action to reconcile outstanding deployments (current state) to match the latest state.
Data Plane Features¶
This section describes various features of the data plane.
Lite vs Enterprise¶
There are two versions of the LangGraph Server: Lite and Enterprise.
The Lite version is a limited version of the LangGraph Server that you can run locally or in a self-hosted manner (up to 1 million nodes executed per year). Lite is only available for the Standalone Container deployment option.
The Enterprise version is the full version of the LangGraph Server. To use the Enterprise version, you must acquire a license key that you will need to specify when running the Docker image. To acquire a license key, please email sales@langchain.dev. Enterprise is available for Cloud SaaS, Self-Hosted Data Plane, and Self-Hosted Control Plane deployment options.
Feature Differences:

Lite
Enterprise

Cron Jobs
❌
✅

Custom Authentication
❌
✅

Autoscaling¶
Production type deployments automatically scale up to 10 containers. Scaling is based on the current request load for a single container. Specifically, the autoscaling implementation scales the deployment so that each container is processing about 10 concurrent requests. For example... 

If the deployment is processing 20 concurrent requests, the deployment will scale up from 1 container to 2 containers (20 requests / 2 containers = 10 requests per container).
If a deployment of 2 containers is processing 10 requests, the deployment will scale down from 2 containers to 1 container (10 requests / 1 container = 10 requests per container).

10 concurrent requests per container is the target threshold. However, 10 concurrent requests per container is not a hard limit. The number of concurrent requests can exceed 10 if there is a sudden burst of requests.
Scale down actions are delayed for 30 minutes before any action is taken. In other words, if the autoscaling implementation decides to scale down a deployment, it will first wait for 30 minutes before scaling down. After 30 minutes, the concurrency metric is recomputed and the deployment will scale down if the concurrency metric has met the target threshold. Otherwise, the deployment remains scaled up. This "cool down" period ensures that deployments do not scale up and down too frequently.
In the future, the autoscaling implementation may evolve to accommodate other metrics such as background run queue size.
Static IP Addresses¶

Only for Cloud SaaS
Static IP addresses are only available for Cloud SaaS deployments.

All traffic from deployments created after January 6th 2025 will come through a NAT gateway. This NAT gateway will have several static IP addresses depending on the data region. Refer to the table below for the list of static IP addresses:

US
EU

35.197.29.146
34.13.192.67

34.145.102.123
34.147.105.64

34.169.45.153
34.90.22.166

34.82.222.17

34.19.93.202
35.204.101.241

34.19.34.50
35.204.48.32

Custom Postgres¶

Only for Self-Hosted Data Plane and Self-Hosted Control Plane
Custom Postgres instances are only available for Self-Hosted Data Plane and Self-Hosted Control Plane deployments.

A custom Postgres instance can be used instead of the one automatically created by the control plane. Specify the POSTGRES_URI_CUSTOM environment variable to use a custom Postgres instance.
Multiple deployments can share the same Postgres instance. For example, for Deployment A, POSTGRES_URI_CUSTOM can be set to postgres://<user>:<password>@/<database_name_1>?host=<hostname_1> and for Deployment B, POSTGRES_URI_CUSTOM can be set to postgres://<user>:<password>@/<database_name_2>?host=<hostname_1>. <database_name_1> and database_name_2 are different databases within the same instance, but <hostname_1> is shared. The same database cannot be used for separate deployments.
Custom Redis¶

Only for Self-Hosted Data Plane and Self-Hosted Control Plane
Custom Redis instances are only available for Self-Hosted Data Plane and Self-Hosted Control Plane deployments.

A custom Redis instance can be used instead of the one automatically created by the control plane. Specify the REDIS_URI_CUSTOM environment variable to use a custom Redis instance.
Multiple deployments can share the same Redis instance. For example, for Deployment A, REDIS_URI_CUSTOM can be set to redis://<hostname_1>:<port>/1 and for Deployment B, REDIS_URI_CUSTOM can be set to redis://<hostname_1>:<port>/2. 1 and 2 are different database numbers within the same instance, but <hostname_1> is shared. The same database number cannot be used for separate deployments.
LangSmith Tracing¶
LangGraph Server is automatically configured to send traces to LangSmith. See the table below for details with respect to each deployment option.

LangGraph Server¶

Prerequisites

LangGraph Platform
LangGraph Glossary

Overview¶
LangGraph Server offers an API for creating and managing agent-based applications. It is built on the concept of assistants, which are agents configured for specific tasks, and includes built-in persistence and a task queue. This versatile API supports a wide range of agentic application use cases, from background processing to real-time interactions.
Key Features¶
The LangGraph Platform incorporates best practices for agent deployment, so you can focus on building your agent logic.

Streaming endpoints: Endpoints that expose multiple different streaming modes. We've made these work even for long-running agents that may go minutes between consecutive stream events.
Background runs: The LangGraph Server supports launching assistants in the background with endpoints for polling the status of the assistant's run and webhooks to monitor run status effectively.
Support for long runs: Our blocking endpoints for running assistants send regular heartbeat signals, preventing unexpected connection closures when handling requests that take a long time to complete.
Task queue: We've added a task queue to make sure we don't drop any requests if they arrive in a bursty nature.
Horizontally scalable infrastructure: LangGraph Server is designed to be horizontally scalable, allowing you to scale up and down your usage as needed.
Double texting support: Many times users might interact with your graph in unintended ways. For instance, a user may send one message and before the graph has finished running send a second message. We call this "double texting" and have added four different ways to handle this.
Optimized checkpointer: LangGraph Platform comes with a built-in checkpointer optimized for LangGraph applications.
Human-in-the-loop endpoints: We've exposed all endpoints needed to support human-in-the-loop features.
Memory: In addition to thread-level persistence (covered above by [checkpointers]l(./persistence.md#checkpoints)), LangGraph Platform also comes with a built-in memory store.
Cron jobs: Built-in support for scheduling tasks, enabling you to automate regular actions like data clean-up or batch processing within your applications.
Webhooks: Allows your application to send real-time notifications and data updates to external systems, making it easy to integrate with third-party services and trigger actions based on specific events.
Monitoring: LangGraph Server integrates seamlessly with the LangSmith monitoring platform, providing real-time insights into your application's performance and health.

What are you deploying?¶
When you deploy a LangGraph Server, you are deploying one or more graphs, a database for persistence, and a task queue.
Graphs¶
When you deploy a graph with LangGraph Server, you are deploying a "blueprint" for an Assistant. 
An Assistant is a graph paired with specific configuration settings. You can create multiple assistants per graph, each with unique settings to accommodate different use cases
that can be served by the same graph.
Upon deployment, LangGraph Server will automatically create a default assistant for each graph using the graph's default configuration settings.
You can interact with assistants through the LangGraph Server API.

Note
We often think of a graph as implementing an agent, but a graph does not necessarily need to implement an agent. For example, a graph could implement a simple
chatbot that only supports back-and-forth conversation, without the ability to influence any application control flow. In reality, as applications get more complex, a graph will often implement a more complex flow that may use multiple agents working in tandem.

Persistence and Task Queue¶
The LangGraph Server leverages a database for persistence and a task queue.
Currently, only Postgres is supported as a database for LangGraph Server and Redis as the task queue.
If you're deploying using LangGraph Cloud, these components are managed for you. If you're deploying LangGraph Server on your own infrastructure, you'll need to set up and manage these components yourself.
Please review the deployment options guide for more information on how these components are set up and managed.
Application Structure¶
To deploy a LangGraph Server application, you need to specify the graph(s) you want to deploy, as well as any relevant configuration settings, such as dependencies and environment variables.
Read the application structure guide to learn how to structure your LangGraph application for deployment.
LangGraph Server API¶
The LangGraph Server API allows you to create and manage assistants, threads, runs, cron jobs, and more.
The LangGraph Cloud API Reference provides detailed information on the API endpoints and data models.
Assistants¶
An Assistant refers to a graph plus specific configuration settings for that graph.
You can think of an assistant as a saved configuration of an agent.
When building agents, it is fairly common to make rapid changes that do not alter the graph logic. For example, simply changing prompts or the LLM selection can have significant impacts on the behavior of the agents. Assistants offer an easy way to make and save these types of changes to agent configuration.
Threads¶
A thread contains the accumulated state of a sequence of runs. If a run is executed on a thread, then the state of the underlying graph of the assistant will be persisted to the thread.
A thread's current and historical state can be retrieved. To persist state, a thread must be created prior to executing a run.
The state of a thread at a particular point in time is called a checkpoint. Checkpoints can be used to restore the state of a thread at a later time.
For more on threads and checkpoints, see this section of the LangGraph conceptual guide.
The LangGraph Cloud API provides several endpoints for creating and managing threads and thread state. See the API reference for more details.
Runs¶
A run is an invocation of an assistant. Each run may have its own input, configuration, and metadata, which may affect execution and output of the underlying graph. A run can optionally be executed on a thread.
The LangGraph Cloud API provides several endpoints for creating and managing runs. See the API reference for more details.
Store¶
Store is an API for managing persistent key-value store that is available from any thread.
Stores are useful for implementing memory in your LangGraph application.
Cron Jobs¶
There are many situations in which it is useful to run an assistant on a schedule. 
For example, say that you're building an assistant that runs daily and sends an email summary
of the day's news. You could use a cron job to run the assistant every day at 8:00 PM.
LangGraph Cloud supports cron jobs, which run on a user-defined schedule. The user specifies a schedule, an assistant, and some input. After that, on the specified schedule, the server will:

Create a new thread with the specified assistant
Send the specified input to that thread

Note that this sends the same input to the thread every time. See the how-to guide for creating cron jobs.
The LangGraph Cloud API provides several endpoints for creating and managing cron jobs. See the API reference for more details.
Webhooks¶
Webhooks enable event-driven communication from your LangGraph Cloud application to external services. For example, you may want to issue an update to a separate service once an API call to LangGraph Cloud has finished running.
Many LangGraph Cloud endpoints accept a webhook parameter. If this parameter is specified by a an endpoint that can accept POST requests, LangGraph Cloud will send a request at the completion of a run.
See the corresponding how-to guide for more detail.

FAQ¶
Common questions and their answers!
Do I need to use LangChain to use LangGraph? What’s the difference?¶
No. LangGraph is an orchestration framework for complex agentic systems and is more low-level and controllable than LangChain agents. LangChain provides a standard interface to interact with models and other components, useful for straight-forward chains and retrieval flows.
How is LangGraph different from other agent frameworks?¶
Other agentic frameworks can work for simple, generic tasks but fall short for complex tasks bespoke to a company’s needs. LangGraph provides a more expressive framework to handle companies’ unique tasks without restricting users to a single black-box cognitive architecture.
Does LangGraph impact the performance of my app?¶
LangGraph will not add any overhead to your code and is specifically designed with streaming workflows in mind.
Is LangGraph open source? Is it free?¶
Yes. LangGraph is an MIT-licensed open-source library and is free to use.
How are LangGraph and LangGraph Platform different?¶

What are my deployment options for LangGraph Platform?¶
We currently have the following deployment options for LangGraph applications:

‍Self-Hosted Lite: A free (up to 1M nodes executed), limited version of LangGraph Platform that you can run locally or in a self-hosted manner. This version requires a LangSmith API key and logs all usage to LangSmith. Fewer features are available than in paid plans.
Cloud SaaS: Fully managed and hosted as part of LangSmith, with automatic updates and zero maintenance.
‍Bring Your Own Cloud (BYOC): Deploy LangGraph Platform within your VPC, provisioned and run as a service. Keep data in your environment while outsourcing the management of the service.
Self-Hosted Enterprise: Deploy LangGraph entirely on your own infrastructure.

Is LangGraph Platform open source?¶
No. LangGraph Platform is proprietary software.
There is a free, self-hosted version of LangGraph Platform with access to basic features. The Cloud SaaS deployment option is free while in beta, but will eventually be a paid service. We will always give ample notice before charging for a service and reward our early adopters with preferential pricing. The Bring Your Own Cloud (BYOC) and Self-Hosted Enterprise options are also paid services. Contact our sales team to learn more.
For more information, see our LangGraph Platform pricing page.
Does LangGraph work with LLMs that don't support tool calling?¶
Yes! You can use LangGraph with any LLMs. The main reason we use LLMs that support tool calling is that this is often the most convenient way to have the LLM make its decision about what to do. If your LLM does not support tool calling, you can still use it - you just need to write a bit of logic to convert the raw LLM string response to a decision about what to do.
Does LangGraph work with OSS LLMs?¶
Yes! LangGraph is totally ambivalent to what LLMs are used under the hood. The main reason we use closed LLMs in most of the tutorials is that they seamlessly support tool calling, while OSS LLMs often don't. But tool calling is not necessary (see this section) so you can totally use LangGraph with OSS LLMs.
Can I use LangGraph Studio without logging to LangSmith¶
Yes! You can use the development version of LangGraph Server to run the backend locally.
This will connect to the studio frontend hosted as part of LangSmith.
If you set an environment variable of LANGSMITH_TRACING=false then no traces will be sent to LangSmith.

LangGraph Studio¶

Prerequisites

LangGraph Platform
LangGraph Server

LangGraph Studio offers a new way to develop LLM applications by providing a specialized agent IDE that enables visualization, interaction, and debugging of complex agentic applications.
With visual graphs and the ability to edit state, you can better understand agent workflows and iterate faster. LangGraph Studio integrates with LangSmith allowing you to collaborate with teammates to debug failure modes.

Features¶
The key features of LangGraph Studio are:

Visualize your graphs
Test your graph by running it from the UI
Debug your agent by modifying its state and rerunning
Create and manage assistants
View and manage threads
View and manage long term memory
Add node input/outputs to LangSmith datasets for testing

Getting started¶
There are two ways to connect your LangGraph app with the studio:
Deployed Application¶
If you have deployed your LangGraph application on LangGraph Platform, you can access the studio as part of that deployment. To do so, navigate to the deployment in LangGraph Platform within the LangSmith UI and click the "LangGraph Studio" button.
Local Development Server¶
If you have a LangGraph application that is running locally in-memory, you can connect it to LangGraph Studio in the browser within LangSmith.
By default, starting the local server with langgraph dev will run the server at http://127.0.0.1:2024 and automatically open Studio in your browser. However, you can also manually connect to Studio by either:

In LangGraph Platform, clicking the "LangGraph Studio" button and entering the server URL in the dialog that appears.

or

Navigating to the URL in your browser:

https://smith.langchain.com/studio/?baseUrl=http://127.0.0.1:2024

LangGraph Studio FAQs¶
Why is my project failing to start?¶
A project may fail to start if the configuration file is defined incorrectly, or if required environment variables are missing. See here for how your configuration file should be defined.
How does interrupt work?¶
When you select the Interrupts dropdown and select a node to interrupt the graph will pause execution before and after (unless the node goes straight to END) that node has run. This means that you will be able to both edit the state before the node is ran and the state after the node has ran. This is intended to allow developers more fine-grained control over the behavior of a node and make it easier to observe how the node is behaving. You will not be able to edit the state after the node has ran if the node is the final node in the graph.
For more information on interrupts and human in the loop, see here.
Why are extra edges showing up in my graph?¶
If you don't define your conditional edges carefully, you might notice extra edges appearing in your graph. This is because without proper definition, LangGraph Studio assumes the conditional edge could access all other nodes. In order for this to not be the case, you need to be explicit about how you define the nodes the conditional edge routes to. There are two ways you can do this:
Solution 1: Include a path map¶
The first way to solve this is to add path maps to your conditional edges. A path map is just a dictionary or array that maps the possible outputs of your router function with the names of the nodes that each output corresponds to. The path map is passed as the third argument to the add_conditional_edges function like so:
PythonJavascript

graph.add_conditional_edges("node_a", routing_function, {True: "node_b", False: "node_c"})

graph.addConditionalEdges("node_a", routingFunction, { true: "node_b", false: "node_c" });

In this case, the routing function returns either True or False, which map to node_b and node_c respectively.
Solution 2: Update the typing of the router (Python only)¶
Instead of passing a path map, you can also be explicit about the typing of your routing function by specifying the nodes it can map to using the Literal python definition. Here is an example of how to define a routing function in that way:
def routing_function(state: GraphState) -> Literal["node_b","node_c"]:
    if state['some_condition'] == True:
        return "node_b"
    else:
        return "node_c"

Studio Desktop FAQs¶

Deprecation Warning
In order to support a wider range of platforms and users, we now recommend following the above instructions to connect to LangGraph Studio using the development server instead of the desktop app.

The LangGraph Studio Desktop App is a standalone application that allows you to connect to your LangGraph application and visualize and interact with your graph. It is available for MacOS only and requires Docker to be installed.
Why is my project failing to start?¶
In addition to the reasons listed above, for the desktop app there are a few more reasons that your project might fail to start:

Note 
LangGraph Studio Desktop automatically populates LANGCHAIN_* environment variables for license verification and tracing, regardless of the contents of the .env file. All other environment variables defined in .env will be read as normal.

Docker issues¶
LangGraph Studio (desktop) requires Docker Desktop version 4.24 or higher. Please make sure you have a version of Docker installed that satisfies that requirement and also make sure you have the Docker Desktop app up and running before trying to use LangGraph Studio. In addition, make sure you have docker-compose updated to version 2.22.0 or higher.
Incorrect data region¶
If you receive a license verification error when attempting to start the LangGraph Server, you may be logged into the incorrect LangSmith data region. Ensure that you're logged into the correct LangSmith data region and ensure that the LangSmith account has access to LangGraph platform.

In the top right-hand corner, click the user icon and select Logout.
At the login screen, click the Data Region dropdown menu and select the appropriate data region. Then click Login to LangSmith.

How do I reload the app?¶
If you would like to reload the app, don't use Command+R as you might normally do. Instead, close and reopen the app for a full refresh.
How does automatic rebuilding work?¶
One of the key features of LangGraph Studio is that it automatically rebuilds your image when you change the source code. This allows for a super fast development and testing cycle which makes it easy to iterate on your graph. There are two different ways that LangGraph rebuilds your image: either by editing the image or completely rebuilding it.
Rebuilds from source code changes¶
If you modified the source code only (no configuration or dependency changes!) then the image does not require a full rebuild, and LangGraph Studio will only update the relevant parts. The UI status in the bottom left will switch from Online to Stopping temporarily while the image gets edited. The logs will be shown as this process is happening, and after the image has been edited the status will change back to Online and you will be able to run your graph with the modified code!
Rebuilds from configuration or dependency changes¶
If you edit your graph configuration file (langgraph.json) or the dependencies (either pyproject.toml or requirements.txt) then the entire image will be rebuilt. This will cause the UI to switch away from the graph view and start showing the logs of the new image building process. This can take a minute or two, and once it is done your updated image will be ready to use!
Why is my graph taking so long to startup?¶
The LangGraph Studio interacts with a local LangGraph API server. To stay aligned with ongoing updates, the LangGraph API requires regular rebuilding. As a result, you may occasionally experience slight delays when starting up your project.

CONTENT:
LangGraph CLI¶

Prerequisites

LangGraph Platform
LangGraph Server

The LangGraph CLI is a multi-platform command-line tool for building and running the LangGraph API server locally. The resulting server includes all API endpoints for your graph's runs, threads, assistants, etc. as well as the other services required to run your agent, including a managed database for checkpointing and storage.
Installation¶
The LangGraph CLI can be installed via Homebrew (on macOS) or pip:
Homebrewpip

brew install langgraph-cli

pip install langgraph-cli

Commands¶
The CLI provides the following core functionality:
build¶
The langgraph build command builds a Docker image for the LangGraph API server that can be directly deployed.
dev¶

New in version 0.1.55
The langgraph dev command was introduced in langgraph-cli version 0.1.55.

Python only
Currently, the CLI only supports Python >= 3.11.
JS support is coming soon.

The langgraph dev command starts a lightweight development server that requires no Docker installation. This server is ideal for rapid development and testing, with features like:

Hot reloading: Changes to your code are automatically detected and reloaded
Debugger support: Attach your IDE's debugger for line-by-line debugging
In-memory state with local persistence: Server state is stored in memory for speed but persisted locally between restarts

To use this command, you need to install the CLI with the "inmem" extra:
pip install -U "langgraph-cli[inmem]"

Note: This command is intended for local development and testing only. It is not recommended for production use. Since it does not use Docker, we recommend using virtual environments to manage your project's dependencies.
up¶
The langgraph up command starts an instance of the LangGraph API server locally in a docker container. This requires thedocker server to be running locally. It also requires a LangSmith API key for local development or a license key for production use.
The server includes all API endpoints for your graph's runs, threads, assistants, etc. as well as the other services required to run your agent, including a managed database for checkpointing and storage.
dockerfile¶
The langgraph dockerfile command generates a Dockerfile that can be used to build images for and deploy instances of the LangGraph API server. This is useful if you want to further customize the dockerfile or deploy in a more custom way.

Updating your langgraph.json file
The langgraph dockerfile command translates all the configuration in your langgraph.json file into Dockerfile commands. When using this command, you will have to re-run it whenever you update your langgraph.json file. Otherwise, your changes will not be reflected when you build or run the dockerfile.

SOURCE: https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/langgraph_platform/
CONTENT:
LangGraph Platform¶
Watch this 4-minute overview of LangGraph Platform to see how it helps you build, deploy, and evaluate agentic applications.

Overview¶
LangGraph Platform is a commercial solution for deploying agentic applications to production, built on the open-source LangGraph framework.
The LangGraph Platform consists of several components that work together to support the development, deployment, debugging, and monitoring of LangGraph applications:

LangGraph Server: The server defines an opinionated API and architecture that incorporates best practices for deploying agentic applications, allowing you to focus on building your agent logic rather than developing server infrastructure.
LangGraph Studio: LangGraph Studio is a specialized IDE that can connect to a LangGraph Server to enable visualization, interaction, and debugging of the application locally.
LangGraph CLI: LangGraph CLI is a command-line interface that helps to interact with a local LangGraph
Python/JS SDK: The Python/JS SDK provides a programmatic way to interact with deployed LangGraph Applications.
Remote Graph: A RemoteGraph allows you to interact with any deployed LangGraph application as though it were running locally.
LangGraph Control Plane: The LangGraph Control Plane refers to the Control Plane UI where users create and update LangGraph Servers and the Control Plane APIs that support the UI experience.
LangGraph Data Plane: The LangGraph Data Plane refers to LangGraph Servers, the corresponding infrastructure for each server, and the "listener" application that continuously polls for updates from the LangGraph Control Plane.

The LangGraph Platform offers a few different deployment options described in the deployment options guide.
Why Use LangGraph Platform?¶
LangGraph Platform handles common issues that arise when deploying LLM applications to production, allowing you to focus on agent logic instead of managing server infrastructure.

Streaming Support: As agents grow more sophisticated, they often benefit from streaming both token outputs and intermediate states back to the user. Without this, users are left waiting for potentially long operations with no feedback. LangGraph Server provides multiple streaming modes optimized for various application needs.

Background Runs: For agents that take longer to process (e.g., hours), maintaining an open connection can be impractical. The LangGraph Server supports launching agent runs in the background and provides both polling endpoints and webhooks to monitor run status effectively.

Support for long runs: Vanilla server setups often encounter timeouts or disruptions when handling requests that take a long time to complete. LangGraph Server’s API provides robust support for these tasks by sending regular heartbeat signals, preventing unexpected connection closures during prolonged processes.

Handling Burstiness: Certain applications, especially those with real-time user interaction, may experience "bursty" request loads where numerous requests hit the server simultaneously. LangGraph Server includes a task queue, ensuring requests are handled consistently without loss, even under heavy loads.

Double Texting: In user-driven applications, it’s common for users to send multiple messages rapidly. This “double texting” can disrupt agent flows if not handled properly. LangGraph Server offers built-in strategies to address and manage such interactions.

Checkpointers and Memory Management: For agents needing persistence (e.g., conversation memory), deploying a robust storage solution can be complex. LangGraph Platform includes optimized checkpointers and a memory store, managing state across sessions without the need for custom solutions.

Human-in-the-loop Support: In many applications, users require a way to intervene in agent processes. LangGraph Server provides specialized endpoints for human-in-the-loop scenarios, simplifying the integration of manual oversight into agent workflows.

By using LangGraph Platform, you gain access to a robust, scalable deployment solution that mitigates these challenges, saving you the effort of implementing and maintaining them manually. This allows you to focus more on building effective agent behavior and less on solving deployment infrastructure issues.

DOCUMENT 15
SOURCE: https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/auth/
CONTENT:
Authentication & Access Control¶
LangGraph Platform provides a flexible authentication and authorization system that can integrate with most authentication schemes.
Core Concepts¶
Authentication vs Authorization¶
While often used interchangeably, these terms represent distinct security concepts:

Authentication ("AuthN") verifies who you are. This runs as middleware for every request.
Authorization ("AuthZ") determines what you can do. This validates the user's privileges and roles on a per-resource basis.

In LangGraph Platform, authentication is handled by your @auth.authenticate handler, and authorization is handled by your @auth.on handlers.
Default Security Models¶
LangGraph Platform provides different security defaults:
LangGraph Cloud¶

Uses LangSmith API keys by default
Requires valid API key in x-api-key header
Can be customized with your auth handler

Custom auth
Custom auth is supported for all plans in LangGraph Cloud.

Self-Hosted¶

No default authentication
Complete flexibility to implement your security model
You control all aspects of authentication and authorization

Custom auth
Custom auth is supported for Enterprise self-hosted plans.
Self-hosted lite plans do not support custom auth natively.

System Architecture¶
A typical authentication setup involves three main components:

Authentication Provider (Identity Provider/IdP)

A dedicated service that manages user identities and credentials
Handles user registration, login, password resets, etc.
Issues tokens (JWT, session tokens, etc.) after successful authentication
Examples: Auth0, Supabase Auth, Okta, or your own auth server

LangGraph Backend (Resource Server)

Your LangGraph application that contains business logic and protected resources
Validates tokens with the auth provider
Enforces access control based on user identity and permissions
Doesn't store user credentials directly

Client Application (Frontend)

Web app, mobile app, or API client
Collects time-sensitive user credentials and sends to auth provider
Receives tokens from auth provider
Includes these tokens in requests to LangGraph backend

Here's how these components typically interact:
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client as Client App
    participant Auth as Auth Provider
    participant LG as LangGraph Backend

    Client->>Auth: 1. Login (username/password)
    Auth-->>Client: 2. Return token
    Client->>LG: 3. Request with token
    Note over LG: 4. Validate token (@auth.authenticate)
    LG-->>Auth:  5. Fetch user info
    Auth-->>LG: 6. Confirm validity
    Note over LG: 7. Apply access control (@auth.on.*)
    LG-->>Client: 8. Return resources
Your @auth.authenticate handler in LangGraph handles steps 4-6, while your @auth.on handlers implement step 7.
Authentication¶
Authentication in LangGraph runs as middleware on every request. Your @auth.authenticate handler receives request information and should:

Validate the credentials
Return user info containing the user's identity and user information if valid
Raise an HTTP exception or AssertionError if invalid

from langgraph_sdk import Auth

auth = Auth()

@auth.authenticate
async def authenticate(headers: dict) -> Auth.types.MinimalUserDict:
    # Validate credentials (e.g., API key, JWT token)
    api_key = headers.get("x-api-key")
    if not api_key or not is_valid_key(api_key):
        raise Auth.exceptions.HTTPException(
            status_code=401,
            detail="Invalid API key"
        )

    # Return user info - only identity and is_authenticated are required
    # Add any additional fields you need for authorization
    return {
        "identity": "user-123",        # Required: unique user identifier
        "is_authenticated": True,      # Optional: assumed True by default
        "permissions": ["read", "write"] # Optional: for permission-based auth
        # You can add more custom fields if you want to implement other auth patterns
        "role": "admin",
        "org_id": "org-456"

    }

The returned user information is available:

To your authorization handlers via ctx.user
In your application via config["configuration"]["langgraph_auth_user"]

Supported Parameters
The @auth.authenticate handler can accept any of the following parameters by name:

request (Request): The raw ASGI request object
body (dict): The parsed request body
path (str): The request path, e.g., "/threads/abcd-1234-abcd-1234/runs/abcd-1234-abcd-1234/stream"
method (str): The HTTP method, e.g., "GET"
path_params (dict[str, str]): URL path parameters, e.g., {"thread_id": "abcd-1234-abcd-1234", "run_id": "abcd-1234-abcd-1234"}
query_params (dict[str, str]): URL query parameters, e.g., {"stream": "true"}
headers (dict[bytes, bytes]): Request headers
authorization (str | None): The Authorization header value (e.g., "Bearer ")

In many of our tutorials, we will just show the "authorization" parameter to be concise, but you can opt to accept more information as needed
to implement your custom authentication scheme.

Authorization¶
After authentication, LangGraph calls your @auth.on handlers to control access to specific resources (e.g., threads, assistants, crons). These handlers can:

Add metadata to be saved during resource creation by mutating the value["metadata"] dictionary directly. See the supported actions table for the list of types the value can take for each action.
Filter resources by metadata during search/list or read operations by returning a filter dictionary.
Raise an HTTP exception if access is denied.

If you want to just implement simple user-scoped access control, you can use a single @auth.on handler for all resources and actions. If you want to have different control depending on the resource and action, you can use resource-specific handlers. See the Supported Resources section for a full list of the resources that support access control.
@auth.on
async def add_owner(
    ctx: Auth.types.AuthContext,
    value: dict  # The payload being sent to this access method
) -> dict:  # Returns a filter dict that restricts access to resources
    """Authorize all access to threads, runs, crons, and assistants.

    This handler does two things:
        - Adds a value to resource metadata (to persist with the resource so it can be filtered later)
        - Returns a filter (to restrict access to existing resources)

    Args:
        ctx: Authentication context containing user info, permissions, the path, and
        value: The request payload sent to the endpoint. For creation
              operations, this contains the resource parameters. For read
              operations, this contains the resource being accessed.

    Returns:
        A filter dictionary that LangGraph uses to restrict access to resources.
        See [Filter Operations](#filter-operations) for supported operators.
    """
    # Create filter to restrict access to just this user's resources
    filters = {"owner": ctx.user.identity}

    # Get or create the metadata dictionary in the payload
    # This is where we store persistent info about the resource
    metadata = value.setdefault("metadata", {})

    # Add owner to metadata - if this is a create or update operation,
    # this information will be saved with the resource
    # So we can filter by it later in read operations
    metadata.update(filters)

    # Return filters to restrict access
    # These filters are applied to ALL operations (create, read, update, search, etc.)
    # to ensure users can only access their own resources
    return filters

Resource-Specific Handlers¶
You can register handlers for specific resources and actions by chaining the resource and action names together with the @auth.on decorator.
When a request is made, the most specific handler that matches that resource and action is called. Below is an example of how to register handlers for specific resources and actions. For the following setup:

Authenticated users are able to create threads, read thread, create runs on threads
Only users with the "assistants:create" permission are allowed to create new assistants
All other endpoints (e.g., e.g., delete assistant, crons, store) are disabled for all users.

Supported Handlers
For a full list of supported resources and actions, see the Supported Resources section below.

# Generic / global handler catches calls that aren't handled by more specific handlers
@auth.on
async def reject_unhandled_requests(ctx: Auth.types.AuthContext, value: Any) -> False:
    print(f"Request to {ctx.path} by {ctx.user.identity}")
    raise Auth.exceptions.HTTPException(
        status_code=403,
        detail="Forbidden"
    )

# Matches the "thread" resource and all actions - create, read, update, delete, search
# Since this is **more specific** than the generic @auth.on handler, it will take precedence
# over the generic handler for all actions on the "threads" resource
@auth.on.threads
async def on_thread_create(
    ctx: Auth.types.AuthContext,
    value: Auth.types.threads.create.value
):
    if "write" not in ctx.permissions:
        raise Auth.exceptions.HTTPException(
            status_code=403,
            detail="User lacks the required permissions."
        )
    # Setting metadata on the thread being created
    # will ensure that the resource contains an "owner" field
    # Then any time a user tries to access this thread or runs within the thread,
    # we can filter by owner
    metadata = value.setdefault("metadata", {})
    metadata["owner"] = ctx.user.identity
    return {"owner": ctx.user.identity}

# Thread creation. This will match only on thread create actions
# Since this is **more specific** than both the generic @auth.on handler and the @auth.on.threads handler,
# it will take precedence for any "create" actions on the "threads" resources
@auth.on.threads.create
async def on_thread_create(
    ctx: Auth.types.AuthContext,
    value: Auth.types.threads.create.value
):
    # Setting metadata on the thread being created
    # will ensure that the resource contains an "owner" field
    # Then any time a user tries to access this thread or runs within the thread,
    # we can filter by owner
    metadata = value.setdefault("metadata", {})
    metadata["owner"] = ctx.user.identity
    return {"owner": ctx.user.identity}

# Reading a thread. Since this is also more specific than the generic @auth.on handler, and the @auth.on.threads handler,
# it will take precedence for any "read" actions on the "threads" resource
@auth.on.threads.read
async def on_thread_read(
    ctx: Auth.types.AuthContext,
    value: Auth.types.threads.read.value
):
    # Since we are reading (and not creating) a thread,
    # we don't need to set metadata. We just need to
    # return a filter to ensure users can only see their own threads
    return {"owner": ctx.user.identity}

# Run creation, streaming, updates, etc.
# This takes precedenceover the generic @auth.on handler and the @auth.on.threads handler
@auth.on.threads.create_run
async def on_run_create(
    ctx: Auth.types.AuthContext,
    value: Auth.types.threads.create_run.value
):
    metadata = value.setdefault("metadata", {})
    metadata["owner"] = ctx.user.identity
    # Inherit thread's access control
    return {"owner": ctx.user.identity}

# Assistant creation
@auth.on.assistants.create
async def on_assistant_create(
    ctx: Auth.types.AuthContext,
    value: Auth.types.assistants.create.value
):
    if "assistants:create" not in ctx.permissions:
        raise Auth.exceptions.HTTPException(
            status_code=403,
            detail="User lacks the required permissions."
        )

Notice that we are mixing global and resource-specific handlers in the above example. Since each request is handled by the most specific handler, a request to create a thread would match the on_thread_create handler but NOT the reject_unhandled_requests handler. A request to update a thread, however would be handled by the global handler, since we don't have a more specific handler for that resource and action.
Filter Operations¶
Authorization handlers can return None, a boolean, or a filter dictionary.
- None and True mean "authorize access to all underling resources"
- False means "deny access to all underling resources (raises a 403 exception)"
- A metadata filter dictionary will restrict access to resources
A filter dictionary is a dictionary with keys that match the resource metadata. It supports three operators:

The default value is a shorthand for exact match, or "$eq", below. For example, {"owner": user_id} will include only resources with metadata containing {"owner": user_id}
$eq: Exact match (e.g., {"owner": {"$eq": user_id}}) - this is equivalent to the shorthand above, {"owner": user_id}
$contains: List membership (e.g., {"allowed_users": {"$contains": user_id}}) The value here must be an element of the list. The metadata in the stored resource must be a list/container type.

A dictionary with multiple keys is treated using a logical AND filter. For example, {"owner": org_id, "allowed_users": {"$contains": user_id}} will only match resources with metadata whose "owner" is org_id and whose "allowed_users" list contains user_id.
See the reference here for more information.
Common Access Patterns¶
Here are some typical authorization patterns:
Single-Owner Resources¶
This common pattern lets you scope all threads, assistants, crons, and runs to a single user. It's useful for common single-user use cases like regular chatbot-style apps.
@auth.on
async def owner_only(ctx: Auth.types.AuthContext, value: dict):
    metadata = value.setdefault("metadata", {})
    metadata["owner"] = ctx.user.identity
    return {"owner": ctx.user.identity}

Permission-based Access¶
This pattern lets you control access based on permissions. It's useful if you want certain roles to have broader or more restricted access to resources.
# In your auth handler:
@auth.authenticate
async def authenticate(headers: dict) -> Auth.types.MinimalUserDict:
    ...
    return {
        "identity": "user-123",
        "is_authenticated": True,
        "permissions": ["threads:write", "threads:read"]  # Define permissions in auth
    }

def _default(ctx: Auth.types.AuthContext, value: dict):
    metadata = value.setdefault("metadata", {})
    metadata["owner"] = ctx.user.identity
    return {"owner": ctx.user.identity}

@auth.on.threads.create
async def create_thread(ctx: Auth.types.AuthContext, value: dict):
    if "threads:write" not in ctx.permissions:
        raise Auth.exceptions.HTTPException(
            status_code=403,
            detail="Unauthorized"
        )
    return _default(ctx, value)

@auth.on.threads.read
async def rbac_create(ctx: Auth.types.AuthContext, value: dict):
    if "threads:read" not in ctx.permissions and "threads:write" not in ctx.permissions:
        raise Auth.exceptions.HTTPException(
            status_code=403,
            detail="Unauthorized"
        )
    return _default(ctx, value)

Supported Resources¶
LangGraph provides three levels of authorization handlers, from most general to most specific:

Global Handler (@auth.on): Matches all resources and actions
Resource Handler (e.g., @auth.on.threads, @auth.on.assistants, @auth.on.crons): Matches all actions for a specific resource
Action Handler (e.g., @auth.on.threads.create, @auth.on.threads.read): Matches a specific action on a specific resource

The most specific matching handler will be used. For example, @auth.on.threads.create takes precedence over @auth.on.threads for thread creation.
If a more specific handler is registered, the more general handler will not be called for that resource and action.

Type Safety
Each handler has type hints available for its value parameter at Auth.types.on.<resource>.<action>.value. For example:
@auth.on.threads.create
async def on_thread_create(
    ctx: Auth.types.AuthContext,
    value: Auth.types.on.threads.create.value  # Specific type for thread creation
):
    ...

@auth.on.threads
async def on_threads(
    ctx: Auth.types.AuthContext,
    value: Auth.types.on.threads.value  # Union type of all thread actions
):
    ...

@auth.on
async def on_all(
    ctx: Auth.types.AuthContext,
    value: dict  # Union type of all possible actions
):
    ...

More specific handlers provide better type hints since they handle fewer action types.

Supported actions and types¶
Here are all the supported action handlers:

Resource

Threads
@auth.on.threads.create

@auth.on.crons.update
Cron job updates
CronsUpdate

@auth.on.crons.delete
Cron job deletion
CronsDelete

@auth.on.crons.search
Listing cron jobs
CronsSearch

About Runs
Runs are scoped to their parent thread for access control. This means permissions are typically inherited from the thread, reflecting the conversational nature of the data model. All run operations (reading, listing) except creation are controlled by the thread's handlers.
There is a specific create_run handler for creating new runs because it had more arguments that you can view in the handler.

Application Structure¶

Prerequisites

LangGraph Server
LangGraph Glossary

Overview¶
A LangGraph application consists of one or more graphs, a LangGraph API Configuration file (langgraph.json), a file that specifies dependencies, and an optional .env file that specifies environment variables.
This guide shows a typical structure for a LangGraph application and shows how the required information to deploy a LangGraph application using the LangGraph Platform is specified.
Key Concepts¶
To deploy using the LangGraph Platform, the following information should be provided:

A LangGraph API Configuration file (langgraph.json) that specifies the dependencies, graphs, environment variables to use for the application.
The graphs that implement the logic of the application.
A file that specifies dependencies required to run the application.
Environment variable that are required for the application to run.

File Structure¶
Below are examples of directory structures for Python and JavaScript applications:
Python (requirements.txt)Python (pyproject.toml)JS (package.json)

my-app/
├── my_agent # all project code lies within here
│   ├── utils # utilities for your graph
│   │   ├── __init__.py
│   │   ├── tools.py # tools for your graph
│   │   ├── nodes.py # node functions for you graph
│   │   └── state.py # state definition of your graph
│   ├── __init__.py
│   └── agent.py # code for constructing your graph
├── .env # environment variables
├── requirements.txt # package dependencies
└── langgraph.json # configuration file for LangGraph

my-app/
├── my_agent # all project code lies within here
│   ├── utils # utilities for your graph
│   │   ├── __init__.py
│   │   ├── tools.py # tools for your graph
│   │   ├── nodes.py # node functions for you graph
│   │   └── state.py # state definition of your graph
│   ├── __init__.py
│   └── agent.py # code for constructing your graph
├── .env # environment variables
├── langgraph.json  # configuration file for LangGraph
└── pyproject.toml # dependencies for your project

my-app/
├── src # all project code lies within here
│   ├── utils # optional utilities for your graph
│   │   ├── tools.ts # tools for your graph
│   │   ├── nodes.ts # node functions for you graph
│   │   └── state.ts # state definition of your graph
│   └── agent.ts # code for constructing your graph
├── package.json # package dependencies
├── .env # environment variables
└── langgraph.json # configuration file for LangGraph

Note
The directory structure of a LangGraph application can vary depending on the programming language and the package manager used.

Configuration File¶
The langgraph.json file is a JSON file that specifies the dependencies, graphs, environment variables, and other settings required to deploy a LangGraph application.
The file supports specification of the following information:

Key
Description

dependencies
Required. Array of dependencies for LangGraph API server. Dependencies can be one of the following: (1) ".", which will look for local Python packages, (2) pyproject.toml, setup.py or requirements.txt in the app directory "./local_package", or (3) a package name.

graphs
Required. Mapping from graph ID to path where the compiled graph or a function that makes a graph is defined. Example: ./your_package/your_file.py:variable, where variable is an instance of langgraph.graph.state.CompiledStateGraph./your_package/your_file.py:make_graph, where make_graph is a function that takes a config dictionary (langchain_core.runnables.RunnableConfig) and creates an instance of langgraph.graph.state.StateGraph / langgraph.graph.state.CompiledStateGraph.

env
Path to .env file or a mapping from environment variable to its value.

python_version
3.11 or 3.12. Defaults to 3.11.

pip_config_file
Path to pip config file.

dockerfile_lines
Array of additional lines to add to Dockerfile following the import from parent image.

Tip
The LangGraph CLI defaults to using the configuration file langgraph.json in the current directory.

Examples¶
PythonJavaScript

The dependencies involve a custom local package and the langchain_openai package.
A single graph will be loaded from the file ./your_package/your_file.py with the variable variable.
The environment variables are loaded from the .env file.

{
    "dependencies": [
        "langchain_openai",
        "./your_package"
    ],
    "graphs": {
        "my_agent": "./your_package/your_file.py:agent"
    },
    "env": "./.env"
}

The dependencies will be loaded from a dependency file in the local directory (e.g., package.json).
A single graph will be loaded from the file ./your_package/your_file.js with the function agent.
The environment variable OPENAI_API_KEY is set inline.

{
    "dependencies": [
        "."
    ],
    "graphs": {
        "my_agent": "./your_package/your_file.js:agent"
    },
    "env": {
        "OPENAI_API_KEY": "secret-key"
    }
}

Dependencies¶
A LangGraph application may depend on other Python packages or JavaScript libraries (depending on the programming language in which the application is written).
You will generally need to specify the following information for dependencies to be set up correctly:

A file in the directory that specifies the dependencies (e.g., requirements.txt, pyproject.toml, or package.json).
A dependencies key in the LangGraph configuration file that specifies the dependencies required to run the LangGraph application.
Any additional binaries or system libraries can be specified using dockerfile_lines key in the LangGraph configuration file.

Graphs¶
Use the graphs key in the LangGraph configuration file to specify which graphs will be available in the deployed LangGraph application.
You can specify one or more graphs in the configuration file. Each graph is identified by a name (which should be unique) and a path for either: (1) the compiled graph or (2) a function that makes a graph is defined.
Environment Variables¶
If you're working with a deployed LangGraph application locally, you can configure environment variables in the env key of the LangGraph configuration file.
For a production deployment, you will typically want to configure the environment variables in the deployment environment.

Double Texting¶

Prerequisites

LangGraph Server

Many times users might interact with your graph in unintended ways. 
For instance, a user may send one message and before the graph has finished running send a second message. 
More generally, users may invoke the graph a second time before the first run has finished.
We call this "double texting".
Currently, LangGraph only addresses this as part of LangGraph Platform, not in the open source.
The reason for this is that in order to handle this we need to know how the graph is deployed, and since LangGraph Platform deals with deployment the logic needs to live there.
If you do not want to use LangGraph Platform, we describe the options we have implemented in detail below.

Reject¶
This is the simplest option, this just rejects any follow-up runs and does not allow double texting. 
See the how-to guide for configuring the reject double text option.
Enqueue¶
This is a relatively simple option which continues the first run until it completes the whole run, then sends the new input as a separate run. 
See the how-to guide for configuring the enqueue double text option.
Interrupt¶
This option interrupts the current execution but saves all the work done up until that point. 
It then inserts the user input and continues from there. 
If you enable this option, your graph should be able to handle weird edge cases that may arise. 
For example, you could have called a tool but not yet gotten back a result from running that tool.
You may need to remove that tool call in order to not have a dangling tool call.
See the how-to guide for configuring the interrupt double text option.
Rollback¶
This option interrupts the current execution AND rolls back all work done up until that point, including the original run input. It then sends the new user input in, basically as if it was the original input.
See the how-to guide for configuring the rollback double text option.

Assistants¶

Prerequisites

LangGraph Server

When building agents, it is fairly common to make rapid changes that do not alter the graph logic. For example, simply changing prompts or the LLM selection can have significant impacts on the behavior of the agents. Assistants offer an easy way to make and save these types of changes to agent configuration. This can have at least two use-cases:

Assistants give developers a quick and easy way to modify and version agents for experimentation.
Assistants can be modified via LangGraph Studio, offering a no-code way to configure agents  (e.g., for business users). 

Assistants build off the concept of "configuration". 
While "configuration" is available in the open source LangGraph library as well,  assistants are only present in LangGraph Platform.
This is because Assistants are tightly coupled to your deployed graph, and so we can only make them available when we are also deploying the graphs.
Configuring Assistants¶
In practice, an assistant is just an instance of a graph with a specific configuration. Because of this, multiple assistants can reference the same graph but can contain different configurations, such as prompts, models, and other graph configuration options. The LangGraph Cloud API provides several endpoints for creating and managing assistants. See the API reference and this how-to for more details on how to create assistants.
Versioning Assistants¶
Once you've created an assistant, you can save and version it to track changes to the configuration over time. You can think about this at three levels:
1) The graph lays out the general agent application logic 
2) The agent configuration options represent parameters that can be changed 
3) Assistant versions save and track specific settings of the agent configuration options 
For example, let's imagine you have a general writing agent. You have created a general graph architecture that works well for writing. However, there are different types of writing, e.g. blogs vs tweets. In order to get the best performance on each use case, you need to make some minor changes to the models and prompts used. In this setup, you could create an assistant for each use case - one for blog writing and one for tweeting. These would share the same graph structure, but they may use different models and different prompts. Read this how-to to learn how you can use assistant versioning through both the Studio and the SDK.

LangGraph Platform Architecture¶

How we use Postgres¶
Postgres is the persistence layer for all user and run data in LGP. This stores both checkpoints (see more info here) as well as the server resources (threads, runs, assistants and crons).
How we use Redis¶
Redis is used in each LGP deployment as a way for server and queue workers to communicate, and to store ephemeral metadata, more details on both below. No user/run data is stored in Redis.
Communication¶
All runs in LGP are executed by the pool of background workers that are part of each deployment. In order to enable some features for those runs (such as cancellation and output streaming) we need a channel for two-way communication between the server and the worker handling a particular run. We use Redis to organize that communication.

A Redis list is used as a mechanism to wake up a worker as soon as a new run is created. Only a sentinel value is stored in this list, no actual run info. The run information is then retrieved from Postgres by the worker.
A combination of a Redis string and Redis PubSub channel is used for the server to communicate a run cancellation request to the appropriate worker.
A Redis PubSub channel is used by the worker to broadcast streaming output from an agent while the run is being handled. Any open /stream request in the server will subscribe to that channel and forward any events to the response as they arrive. No events are stored in Redis at any time.

Ephemeral metadata¶
Runs in an LGP deployment may be retried for specific failures (currently only for transient Postgres errors encountered during the run). In order to limit the number of retries (currently limited to 3 attempts per run) we record the attempt number in a Redis string when is picked up. This contains no run-specific info other than its ID, and expires after a short delay.

Persistence¶
LangGraph has a built-in persistence layer, implemented through checkpointers. When you compile graph with a checkpointer, the checkpointer saves a checkpoint of the graph state at every super-step. Those checkpoints are saved to a thread, which can be accessed after graph execution. Because threads allow access to graph's state after execution, several powerful capabilities including human-in-the-loop, memory, time travel, and fault-tolerance are all possible. See this how-to guide for an end-to-end example on how to add and use checkpointers with your graph. Below, we'll discuss each of these concepts in more detail. 

LangGraph API handles checkpointing automatically
When using the LangGraph API, you don't need to implement or configure checkpointers manually. The API handles all persistence infrastructure for you behind the scenes.

Threads¶
A thread is a unique ID or thread identifier assigned to each checkpoint saved by a checkpointer. When invoking graph with a checkpointer, you must specify a thread_id as part of the configurable portion of the config:
{"configurable": {"thread_id": "1"}}

Checkpoints¶
Checkpoint is a snapshot of the graph state saved at each super-step and is represented by StateSnapshot object with the following key properties:

config: Config associated with this checkpoint. 
metadata: Metadata associated with this checkpoint.
values: Values of the state channels at this point in time.
next A tuple of the node names to execute next in the graph.
tasks: A tuple of PregelTask objects that contain information about next tasks to be executed. If the step was previously attempted, it will include error information. If a graph was interrupted dynamically from within a node, tasks will contain additional data associated with interrupts.

Let's see what checkpoints are saved when a simple graph is invoked as follows:
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END
from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import InMemorySaver
from typing import Annotated
from typing_extensions import TypedDict
from operator import add

class State(TypedDict):
    foo: str
    bar: Annotated[list[str], add]

def node_a(state: State):
    return {"foo": "a", "bar": ["a"]}

def node_b(state: State):
    return {"foo": "b", "bar": ["b"]}

workflow = StateGraph(State)
workflow.add_node(node_a)
workflow.add_node(node_b)
workflow.add_edge(START, "node_a")
workflow.add_edge("node_a", "node_b")
workflow.add_edge("node_b", END)

checkpointer = InMemorySaver()
graph = workflow.compile(checkpointer=checkpointer)

config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "1"}}
graph.invoke({"foo": ""}, config)

API Reference: StateGraph | START | END
After we run the graph, we expect to see exactly 4 checkpoints:

empty checkpoint with START as the next node to be executed
checkpoint with the user input {'foo': '', 'bar': []} and node_a as the next node to be executed
checkpoint with the outputs of node_a {'foo': 'a', 'bar': ['a']} and node_b as the next node to be executed
checkpoint with the outputs of node_b {'foo': 'b', 'bar': ['a', 'b']} and no next nodes to be executed

Note that we bar channel values contain outputs from both nodes as we have a reducer for bar channel.
Get state¶
When interacting with the saved graph state, you must specify a thread identifier. You can view the latest state of the graph by calling graph.get_state(config). This will return a StateSnapshot object that corresponds to the latest checkpoint associated with the thread ID provided in the config or a checkpoint associated with a checkpoint ID for the thread, if provided.
# get the latest state snapshot
config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "1"}}
graph.get_state(config)

# get a state snapshot for a specific checkpoint_id
config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "1", "checkpoint_id": "1ef663ba-28fe-6528-8002-5a559208592c"}}
graph.get_state(config)

In our example, the output of get_state will look like this:
StateSnapshot(
    values={'foo': 'b', 'bar': ['a', 'b']},
    next=(),
    config={'configurable': {'thread_id': '1', 'checkpoint_ns': '', 'checkpoint_id': '1ef663ba-28fe-6528-8002-5a559208592c'}},
    metadata={'source': 'loop', 'writes': {'node_b': {'foo': 'b', 'bar': ['b']}}, 'step': 2},
    created_at='2024-08-29T19:19:38.821749+00:00',
    parent_config={'configurable': {'thread_id': '1', 'checkpoint_ns': '', 'checkpoint_id': '1ef663ba-28f9-6ec4-8001-31981c2c39f8'}}, tasks=()
)

Get state history¶
You can get the full history of the graph execution for a given thread by calling graph.get_state_history(config). This will return a list of StateSnapshot objects associated with the thread ID provided in the config. Importantly, the checkpoints will be ordered chronologically with the most recent checkpoint / StateSnapshot being the first in the list.
config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "1"}}
list(graph.get_state_history(config))

In our example, the output of get_state_history will look like this:
[
    StateSnapshot(
        values={'foo': 'b', 'bar': ['a', 'b']},
        next=(),
        config={'configurable': {'thread_id': '1', 'checkpoint_ns': '', 'checkpoint_id': '1ef663ba-28fe-6528-8002-5a559208592c'}},
        metadata={'source': 'loop', 'writes': {'node_b': {'foo': 'b', 'bar': ['b']}}, 'step': 2},
        created_at='2024-08-29T19:19:38.821749+00:00',
        parent_config={'configurable': {'thread_id': '1', 'checkpoint_ns': '', 'checkpoint_id': '1ef663ba-28f9-6ec4-8001-31981c2c39f8'}},
        tasks=(),
    ),
    StateSnapshot(
        values={'foo': 'a', 'bar': ['a']}, next=('node_b',),
        config={'configurable': {'thread_id': '1', 'checkpoint_ns': '', 'checkpoint_id': '1ef663ba-28f9-6ec4-8001-31981c2c39f8'}},
        metadata={'source': 'loop', 'writes': {'node_a': {'foo': 'a', 'bar': ['a']}}, 'step': 1},
        created_at='2024-08-29T19:19:38.819946+00:00',
        parent_config={'configurable': {'thread_id': '1', 'checkpoint_ns': '', 'checkpoint_id': '1ef663ba-28f4-6b4a-8000-ca575a13d36a'}},
        tasks=(PregelTask(id='6fb7314f-f114-5413-a1f3-d37dfe98ff44', name='node_b', error=None, interrupts=()),),
    ),
    StateSnapshot(
        values={'foo': '', 'bar': []},
        next=('node_a',),
        config={'configurable': {'thread_id': '1', 'checkpoint_ns': '', 'checkpoint_id': '1ef663ba-28f4-6b4a-8000-ca575a13d36a'}},

        tasks=(PregelTask(id='f1b14528-5ee5-579c-949b-23ef9bfbed58', name='node_a', error=None, interrupts=()),),
    ),
    StateSnapshot(
        values={'bar': []},
        next=('__start__',),
        config={'configurable': {'thread_id': '1', 'checkpoint_ns': '', 'checkpoint_id': '1ef663ba-28f0-6c66-bfff-6723431e8481'}},
        metadata={'source': 'input', 'writes': {'foo': ''}, 'step': -1},

    )
]

Replay¶
It's also possible to play-back a prior graph execution. If we invoke a graph with a thread_id and a checkpoint_id, then we will re-play the previously executed steps before a checkpoint that corresponds to the checkpoint_id, and only execute the steps after the checkpoint.

thread_id is the ID of a thread.
checkpoint_id is an identifier that refers to a specific checkpoint within a thread.

You must pass these when invoking the graph as part of the configurable portion of the config:
config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "1", "checkpoint_id": "0c62ca34-ac19-445d-bbb0-5b4984975b2a"}}
graph.invoke(None, config=config)

Importantly, LangGraph knows whether a particular step has been executed previously. If it has, LangGraph simply re-plays that particular step in the graph and does not re-execute the step, but only for the steps before the provided checkpoint_id. All of the steps after checkpoint_id will be executed (i.e., a new fork), even if they have been executed previously. See this how to guide on time-travel to learn more about replaying.

Update state¶
In addition to re-playing the graph from specific checkpoints, we can also edit the graph state. We do this using graph.update_state(). This method accepts three different arguments:
config¶
The config should contain thread_id specifying which thread to update. When only the thread_id is passed, we update (or fork) the current state. Optionally, if we include checkpoint_id field, then we fork that selected checkpoint.
values¶
These are the values that will be used to update the state. Note that this update is treated exactly as any update from a node is treated. This means that these values will be passed to the reducer functions, if they are defined for some of the channels in the graph state. This means that update_state does NOT automatically overwrite the channel values for every channel, but only for the channels without reducers. Let's walk through an example.
Let's assume you have defined the state of your graph with the following schema (see full example above):
from typing import Annotated
from typing_extensions import TypedDict
from operator import add

class State(TypedDict):
    foo: int
    bar: Annotated[list[str], add]

Let's now assume the current state of the graph is
{"foo": 1, "bar": ["a"]}

If you update the state as below:
graph.update_state(config, {"foo": 2, "bar": ["b"]})

Then the new state of the graph will be:
{"foo": 2, "bar": ["a", "b"]}

The foo key (channel) is completely changed (because there is no reducer specified for that channel, so update_state overwrites it). However, there is a reducer specified for the bar key, and so it appends "b" to the state of bar.
as_node¶
The final thing you can optionally specify when calling update_state is as_node. If you provided it, the update will be applied as if it came from node as_node. If as_node is not provided, it will be set to the last node that updated the state, if not ambiguous. The reason this matters is that the next steps to execute depend on the last node to have given an update, so this can be used to control which node executes next. See this how to guide on time-travel to learn more about forking state.

Memory Store¶

A state schema specifies a set of keys that are populated as a graph is executed. As discussed above, state can be written by a checkpointer to a thread at each graph step, enabling state persistence.
But, what if we want to retain some information across threads? Consider the case of a chatbot where we want to retain specific information about the user across all chat conversations (e.g., threads) with that user!
With checkpointers alone, we cannot share information across threads. This motivates the need for the Store interface. As an illustration, we can define an InMemoryStore to store information about a user across threads. We simply compile our graph with a checkpointer, as before, and with our new in_memory_store variable.
!!!  info "LangGraph API handles stores automatically"
When using the LangGraph API, you don't need to implement or configure stores manually. The API handles all storage infrastructure for you behind the scenes.

Basic Usage¶
First, let's showcase this in isolation without using LangGraph.
from langgraph.store.memory import InMemoryStore
in_memory_store = InMemoryStore()

Memories are namespaced by a tuple, which in this specific example will be (<user_id>, "memories"). The namespace can be any length and represent anything, does not have to be user specific.
user_id = "1"
namespace_for_memory = (user_id, "memories")

We use the store.put method to save memories to our namespace in the store. When we do this, we specify the namespace, as defined above, and a key-value pair for the memory: the key is simply a unique identifier for the memory (memory_id) and the value (a dictionary) is the memory itself.
memory_id = str(uuid.uuid4())
memory = {"food_preference" : "I like pizza"}
in_memory_store.put(namespace_for_memory, memory_id, memory)

We can read out memories in our namespace using the store.search method, which will return all memories for a given user as a list. The most recent memory is the last in the list.
memories = in_memory_store.search(namespace_for_memory)
memories[-1].dict()
{'value': {'food_preference': 'I like pizza'},
 'key': '07e0caf4-1631-47b7-b15f-65515d4c1843',
 'namespace': ['1', 'memories'],
 'created_at': '2024-10-02T17:22:31.590602+00:00',
 'updated_at': '2024-10-02T17:22:31.590605+00:00'}

Each memory type is a Python class (Item) with certain attributes. We can access it as a dictionary by converting via .dict as above.
The attributes it has are:

value: The value (itself a dictionary) of this memory
key: A unique key for this memory in this namespace
namespace: A list of strings, the namespace of this memory type
created_at: Timestamp for when this memory was created
updated_at: Timestamp for when this memory was updated

Semantic Search¶
Beyond simple retrieval, the store also supports semantic search, allowing you to find memories based on meaning rather than exact matches. To enable this, configure the store with an embedding model:
from langchain.embeddings import init_embeddings

store = InMemoryStore(
    index={
        "embed": init_embeddings("openai:text-embedding-3-small"),  # Embedding provider
        "dims": 1536,                              # Embedding dimensions
        "fields": ["food_preference", "$"]              # Fields to embed
    }
)

API Reference: init_embeddings
Now when searching, you can use natural language queries to find relevant memories:
# Find memories about food preferences
# (This can be done after putting memories into the store)
memories = store.search(
    namespace_for_memory,
    query="What does the user like to eat?",
    limit=3  # Return top 3 matches
)

You can control which parts of your memories get embedded by configuring the fields parameter or by specifying the index parameter when storing memories:
# Store with specific fields to embed
store.put(
    namespace_for_memory,
    str(uuid.uuid4()),
    {
        "food_preference": "I love Italian cuisine",
        "context": "Discussing dinner plans"
    },
    index=["food_preference"]  # Only embed "food_preferences" field
)

# Store without embedding (still retrievable, but not searchable)
store.put(
    namespace_for_memory,
    str(uuid.uuid4()),
    {"system_info": "Last updated: 2024-01-01"},
    index=False
)

Using in LangGraph¶
With this all in place, we use the in_memory_store in LangGraph. The in_memory_store works hand-in-hand with the checkpointer: the checkpointer saves state to threads, as discussed above, and the in_memory_store allows us to store arbitrary information for access across threads. We compile the graph with both the checkpointer and the in_memory_store as follows. 
from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import InMemorySaver

# We need this because we want to enable threads (conversations)
checkpointer = InMemorySaver()

# ... Define the graph ...

# Compile the graph with the checkpointer and store
graph = graph.compile(checkpointer=checkpointer, store=in_memory_store)

We invoke the graph with a thread_id, as before, and also with a user_id, which we'll use to namespace our memories to this particular user as we showed above.
# Invoke the graph
user_id = "1"
config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "1", "user_id": user_id}}

# First let's just say hi to the AI
for update in graph.stream(
    {"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "hi"}]}, config, stream_mode="updates"
):
    print(update)

We can access the in_memory_store and the user_id in any node by passing store: BaseStore and config: RunnableConfig as node arguments. Here's how we might use semantic search in a node to find relevant memories:
def update_memory(state: MessagesState, config: RunnableConfig, *, store: BaseStore):

    # Get the user id from the config
    user_id = config["configurable"]["user_id"]

    # Namespace the memory
    namespace = (user_id, "memories")

    # ... Analyze conversation and create a new memory

    # Create a new memory ID
    memory_id = str(uuid.uuid4())

    # We create a new memory
    store.put(namespace, memory_id, {"memory": memory})

As we showed above, we can also access the store in any node and use the store.search method to get memories. Recall the the memories are returned as a list of objects that can be converted to a dictionary.
memories[-1].dict()
{'value': {'food_preference': 'I like pizza'},
 'key': '07e0caf4-1631-47b7-b15f-65515d4c1843',
 'namespace': ['1', 'memories'],
 'created_at': '2024-10-02T17:22:31.590602+00:00',
 'updated_at': '2024-10-02T17:22:31.590605+00:00'}

We can access the memories and use them in our model call.
def call_model(state: MessagesState, config: RunnableConfig, *, store: BaseStore):
    # Get the user id from the config
    user_id = config["configurable"]["user_id"]

    # Namespace the memory
    namespace = (user_id, "memories")

    # Search based on the most recent message
    memories = store.search(
        namespace,
        query=state["messages"][-1].content,
        limit=3
    )
    info = "\n".join([d.value["memory"] for d in memories])

    # ... Use memories in the model call

If we create a new thread, we can still access the same memories so long as the user_id is the same. 
# Invoke the graph
config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "2", "user_id": "1"}}

# Let's say hi again
for update in graph.stream(
    {"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "hi, tell me about my memories"}]}, config, stream_mode="updates"
):
    print(update)

When we use the LangGraph Platform, either locally (e.g., in LangGraph Studio) or with LangGraph Cloud, the base store is available to use by default and does not need to be specified during graph compilation. To enable semantic search, however, you do need to configure the indexing settings in your langgraph.json file. For example:
{
    ...
    "store": {
        "index": {
            "embed": "openai:text-embeddings-3-small",
            "dims": 1536,
            "fields": ["$"]
        }
    }
}

See the deployment guide for more details and configuration options.
Checkpointer libraries¶
Under the hood, checkpointing is powered by checkpointer objects that conform to BaseCheckpointSaver interface. LangGraph provides several checkpointer implementations, all implemented via standalone, installable libraries:

langgraph-checkpoint: The base interface for checkpointer savers (BaseCheckpointSaver) and serialization/deserialization interface (SerializerProtocol). Includes in-memory checkpointer implementation (InMemorySaver) for experimentation. LangGraph comes with langgraph-checkpoint included.
langgraph-checkpoint-sqlite: An implementation of LangGraph checkpointer that uses SQLite database (SqliteSaver / AsyncSqliteSaver). Ideal for experimentation and local workflows. Needs to be installed separately.
langgraph-checkpoint-postgres: An advanced checkpointer that uses Postgres database (PostgresSaver / AsyncPostgresSaver), used in LangGraph Cloud. Ideal for using in production. Needs to be installed separately.

Checkpointer interface¶
Each checkpointer conforms to BaseCheckpointSaver interface and implements the following methods:

.put - Store a checkpoint with its configuration and metadata.  
.put_writes - Store intermediate writes linked to a checkpoint (i.e. pending writes).  
.get_tuple - Fetch a checkpoint tuple using for a given configuration (thread_id and checkpoint_id). This is used to populate StateSnapshot in graph.get_state().  
.list - List checkpoints that match a given configuration and filter criteria. This is used to populate state history in graph.get_state_history()

If the checkpointer is used with asynchronous graph execution (i.e. executing the graph via .ainvoke, .astream, .abatch), asynchronous versions of the above methods will be used (.aput, .aput_writes, .aget_tuple, .alist).

Note
For running your graph asynchronously, you can use InMemorySaver, or async versions of Sqlite/Postgres checkpointers -- AsyncSqliteSaver / AsyncPostgresSaver checkpointers.

Serializer¶
When checkpointers save the graph state, they need to serialize the channel values in the state. This is done using serializer objects. 
langgraph_checkpoint defines protocol for implementing serializers provides a default implementation (JsonPlusSerializer) that handles a wide variety of types, including LangChain and LangGraph primitives, datetimes, enums and more.
Capabilities¶
Human-in-the-loop¶
First, checkpointers facilitate human-in-the-loop workflows workflows by allowing humans to inspect, interrupt, and approve graph steps. Checkpointers are needed for these workflows as the human has to be able to view the state of a graph at any point in time, and the graph has to be to resume execution after the human has made any updates to the state. See these how-to guides for concrete examples.
Memory¶
Second, checkpointers allow for "memory" between interactions.  In the case of repeated human interactions (like conversations) any follow up messages can be sent to that thread, which will retain its memory of previous ones. See this how-to guide for an end-to-end example on how to add and manage conversation memory using checkpointers.
Time Travel¶
Third, checkpointers allow for "time travel", allowing users to replay prior graph executions to review and / or debug specific graph steps. In addition, checkpointers make it possible to fork the graph state at arbitrary checkpoints to explore alternative trajectories.
Fault-tolerance¶
Lastly, checkpointing also provides fault-tolerance and error recovery: if one or more nodes fail at a given superstep, you can restart your graph from the last successful step. Additionally, when a graph node fails mid-execution at a given superstep, LangGraph stores pending checkpoint writes from any other nodes that completed successfully at that superstep, so that whenever we resume graph execution from that superstep we don't re-run the successful nodes.
Pending writes¶
Additionally, when a graph node fails mid-execution at a given superstep, LangGraph stores pending checkpoint writes from any other nodes that completed successfully at that superstep, so that whenever we resume graph execution from that superstep we don't re-run the successful nodes.

Deployment Options¶

Prerequisites

LangGraph Platform
LangGraph Server
LangGraph Platform Plans

Overview¶
There are 4 main options for deploying with the LangGraph Platform:

Cloud SaaS(Beta): Available for Plus and Enterprise plans.

Self-Hosted Data Plane(Beta): Available for the Enterprise plan.

Self-Hosted Control Plane(Beta): Available for the Enterprise plan.

Standalone Container: Available for all plans.

Please see the LangGraph Platform Plans for more information on the different plans.
The guide below will explain the differences between the deployment options.
Cloud SaaS¶
The Cloud SaaS deployment option is a fully managed model for deployment where we manage the control plane and data plane in our cloud. This option provides a simple way to deploy and manage your LangGraph Servers.
Connect your GitHub repositories to the platform and deploy your LangGraph Servers from the Control Plane UI. The build process (i.e. CI/CD) is managed internally by the platform.
For more information, please see:

Cloud SaaS Conceptual Guide
How to deploy to Cloud SaaS

Self-Hosted Data Plane¶
The Self-Hosted Data Plane deployment option is a "hybrid" model for deployemnt where we manage the control plane in our cloud and you manage the data plane in your cloud. This option provides a way to securely manage your data plane infrastructure, while offloading control plane management to us.
Build a Docker image using the LangGraph CLI and deploy your LangGraph Server from the Control Plane UI.
Supported Compute Platforms: Kubernetes, Amazon ECS (coming soon!)
For more information, please see:

Self-Hosted Data Plane Conceptual Guide
How to deploy the Self-Hosted Data Plane

Self-Hosted Control Plane¶
The Self-Hosted Control Plane deployment option is a fully self-hosted model for deployment where you manage the control plane and data plane in your cloud. This option give you full control and responsibility of the control plane and data plane infrastructure.
Build a Docker image using the LangGraph CLI and deploy your LangGraph Server from the Control Plane UI.
Supported Compute Platforms: Kubernetes
For more information, please see:

Self-Hosted Control Plane Conceptual Guide
How to deploy the Self-Hosted Control Plane

Standalone Container¶
The Standalone Container deployment option is the least restrictive model for deployment. Deploy standalone instances of a LangGraph Server in your cloud.
Build a Docker image using the LangGraph CLI and deploy your LangGraph Server using the container deployment tooling of your choice. Images can be deployed to any compute platform.

CONTENT:
Breakpoints¶
Breakpoints pause graph execution at specific points and enable stepping through execution step by step. Breakpoints are powered by LangGraph's persistence layer, which saves the state after each graph step. Breakpoints can also be used to enable human-in-the-loop workflows, though we recommend using the interrupt function for this purpose.
Requirements¶
To use breakpoints, you will need to:

Specify a checkpointer to save the graph state after each step.
Set breakpoints to specify where execution should pause.
Run the graph with a thread ID to pause execution at the breakpoint.
Resume execution using invoke/ainvoke/stream/astream (see The Command primitive).

Setting breakpoints¶
There are two places where you can set breakpoints:

Before or after a node executes by setting breakpoints at compile time or run time. We call these static breakpoints.
Inside a node using the NodeInterrupt exception.

Static breakpoints¶
Static breakpoints are triggered either before or after a node executes. You can set static breakpoints by specifying interrupt_before and interrupt_after at "compile" time or run time.
Compile timeRun time

graph = graph_builder.compile(
    interrupt_before=["node_a"], 
    interrupt_after=["node_b", "node_c"],
    checkpointer=..., # Specify a checkpointer
)

thread_config = {
    "configurable": {
        "thread_id": "some_thread"
    }
}

# Run the graph until the breakpoint
graph.invoke(inputs, config=thread_config)

# Optionally update the graph state based on user input
graph.update_state(update, config=thread_config)

# Resume the graph
graph.invoke(None, config=thread_config)

graph.invoke(
    inputs, 
    config={"configurable": {"thread_id": "some_thread"}}, 
    interrupt_before=["node_a"], 
    interrupt_after=["node_b", "node_c"]
)

thread_config = {
    "configurable": {
        "thread_id": "some_thread"
    }
}

# Run the graph until the breakpoint
graph.invoke(inputs, config=thread_config)

# Optionally update the graph state based on user input
graph.update_state(update, config=thread_config)

# Resume the graph
graph.invoke(None, config=thread_config)

Note
You cannot set static breakpoints at runtime for sub-graphs.
If you have a sub-graph, you must set the breakpoints at compilation time.

Static breakpoints can be especially useful for debugging if you want to step through the graph execution one
node at a time or if you want to pause the graph execution at specific nodes.
NodeInterrupt exception¶
We recommend that you use the interrupt function instead of the NodeInterrupt exception if you're trying to implement
human-in-the-loop workflows. The interrupt function is easier to use and more flexible.

NodeInterrupt exception
The developer can define some condition that must be met for a breakpoint to be triggered. This concept of dynamic breakpoints is useful when the developer wants to halt the graph under a particular condition. This uses a NodeInterrupt, which is a special type of exception that can be raised from within a node based upon some condition. As an example, we can define a dynamic breakpoint that triggers when the input is longer than 5 characters.
def my_node(state: State) -> State:
    if len(state['input']) > 5:
        raise NodeInterrupt(f"Received input that is longer than 5 characters: {state['input']}")

    return state

Let's assume we run the graph with an input that triggers the dynamic breakpoint and then attempt to resume the graph execution simply by passing in None for the input.
# Attempt to continue the graph execution with no change to state after we hit the dynamic breakpoint 
for event in graph.stream(None, thread_config, stream_mode="values"):
    print(event)

The graph will interrupt again because this node will be re-run with the same graph state. We need to change the graph state such that the condition that triggers the dynamic breakpoint is no longer met. So, we can simply edit the graph state to an input that meets the condition of our dynamic breakpoint (< 5 characters) and re-run the node.
# Update the state to pass the dynamic breakpoint
graph.update_state(config=thread_config, values={"input": "foo"})
for event in graph.stream(None, thread_config, stream_mode="values"):
    print(event)

Alternatively, what if we want to keep our current input and skip the node (my_node) that performs the check? To do this, we can simply perform the graph update with as_node="my_node" and pass in None for the values. This will make no update the graph state, but run the update as my_node, effectively skipping the node and bypassing the dynamic breakpoint.
# This update will skip the node `my_node` altogether
graph.update_state(config=thread_config, values=None, as_node="my_node")
for event in graph.stream(None, thread_config, stream_mode="values"):
    print(event)

CONTENT:
Human-in-the-loop¶

This guide uses the new interrupt function.
As of LangGraph 0.2.57, the recommended way to set breakpoints is using the interrupt function as it simplifies human-in-the-loop patterns.
If you're looking for the previous version of this conceptual guide, which relied on static breakpoints and NodeInterrupt exception, it is available here. 

A human-in-the-loop (or "on-the-loop") workflow integrates human input into automated processes, allowing for decisions, validation, or corrections at key stages. This is especially useful in LLM-based applications, where the underlying model may generate occasional inaccuracies. In low-error-tolerance scenarios like compliance, decision-making, or content generation, human involvement ensures reliability by enabling review, correction, or override of model outputs.
Use cases¶
Key use cases for human-in-the-loop workflows in LLM-based applications include:

🛠️ Reviewing tool calls: Humans can review, edit, or approve tool calls requested by the LLM before tool execution.
✅ Validating LLM outputs: Humans can review, edit, or approve content generated by the LLM.
💡 Providing context: Enable the LLM to explicitly request human input for clarification or additional details or to support multi-turn conversations.

interrupt¶
The interrupt function in LangGraph enables human-in-the-loop workflows by pausing the graph at a specific node, presenting information to a human, and resuming the graph with their input. This function is useful for tasks like approvals, edits, or collecting additional input. The interrupt function is used in conjunction with the Command object to resume the graph with a value provided by the human.
from langgraph.types import interrupt

def human_node(state: State):
    value = interrupt(
        # Any JSON serializable value to surface to the human.
        # For example, a question or a piece of text or a set of keys in the state
       {
          "text_to_revise": state["some_text"]
       }
    )
    # Update the state with the human's input or route the graph based on the input.
    return {
        "some_text": value
    }

graph = graph_builder.compile(
    checkpointer=checkpointer # Required for `interrupt` to work
)

# Run the graph until the interrupt
thread_config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "some_id"}}
graph.invoke(some_input, config=thread_config)

# Resume the graph with the human's input
graph.invoke(Command(resume=value_from_human), config=thread_config)

API Reference: interrupt
{'some_text': 'Edited text'}

Warning
Interrupts are both powerful and ergonomic. However, while they may resemble Python's input() function in terms of developer experience, it's important to note that they do not automatically resume execution from the interruption point. Instead, they rerun the entire node where the interrupt was used.
  For this reason, interrupts are typically best placed at the start of a node or in a dedicated node. Please read the resuming from an interrupt section for more details. 

Full Code
Here's a full example of how to use interrupt in a graph, if you'd like
  to see the code in action.
from typing import TypedDict
import uuid

from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver
from langgraph.constants import START
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph
from langgraph.types import interrupt, Command

class State(TypedDict):
   """The graph state."""
   some_text: str

def human_node(state: State):
   value = interrupt(
      # Any JSON serializable value to surface to the human.
      # For example, a question or a piece of text or a set of keys in the state
      {
         "text_to_revise": state["some_text"]
      }
   )
   return {
      # Update the state with the human's input
      "some_text": value
   }

# Build the graph
graph_builder = StateGraph(State)
# Add the human-node to the graph
graph_builder.add_node("human_node", human_node)
graph_builder.add_edge(START, "human_node")

# A checkpointer is required for `interrupt` to work.
checkpointer = MemorySaver()
graph = graph_builder.compile(
   checkpointer=checkpointer
)

# Pass a thread ID to the graph to run it.
thread_config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": uuid.uuid4()}}

# Using stream() to directly surface the `__interrupt__` information.
for chunk in graph.stream({"some_text": "Original text"}, config=thread_config):
   print(chunk)

# Resume using Command
for chunk in graph.stream(Command(resume="Edited text"), config=thread_config):
   print(chunk)

{'__interrupt__': (
      Interrupt(
         value={'question': 'Please revise the text', 'some_text': 'Original text'}, 
         resumable=True, 
         ns=['human_node:10fe492f-3688-c8c6-0d0a-ec61a43fecd6'], 
         when='during'
      ),
   )
}
{'human_node': {'some_text': 'Edited text'}}

Requirements¶
To use interrupt in your graph, you need to:

Specify a checkpointer to save the graph state after each step.
Call interrupt() in the appropriate place. See the Design Patterns section for examples.
Run the graph with a thread ID until the interrupt is hit.
Resume execution using invoke/ainvoke/stream/astream (see The Command primitive).

Design Patterns¶
There are typically three different actions that you can do with a human-in-the-loop workflow:

Approve or Reject: Pause the graph before a critical step, such as an API call, to review and approve the action. If the action is rejected, you can prevent the graph from executing the step, and potentially take an alternative action. This pattern often involve routing the graph based on the human's input.
Edit Graph State: Pause the graph to review and edit the graph state. This is useful for correcting mistakes or updating the state with additional information. This pattern often involves updating the state with the human's input.
Get Input: Explicitly request human input at a particular step in the graph. This is useful for collecting additional information or context to inform the agent's decision-making process or for supporting multi-turn conversations.

Below we show different design patterns that can be implemented using these actions.
Approve or Reject¶

Depending on the human's approval or rejection, the graph can proceed with the action or take an alternative path.

Pause the graph before a critical step, such as an API call, to review and approve the action. If the action is rejected, you can prevent the graph from executing the step, and potentially take an alternative action.
from typing import Literal
from langgraph.types import interrupt, Command

def human_approval(state: State) -> Command[Literal["some_node", "another_node"]]:
    is_approved = interrupt(
        {
            "question": "Is this correct?",
            # Surface the output that should be
            # reviewed and approved by the human.
            "llm_output": state["llm_output"]
        }
    )

    if is_approved:
        return Command(goto="some_node")
    else:
        return Command(goto="another_node")

# Add the node to the graph in an appropriate location
# and connect it to the relevant nodes.
graph_builder.add_node("human_approval", human_approval)
graph = graph_builder.compile(checkpointer=checkpointer)

# After running the graph and hitting the interrupt, the graph will pause.
# Resume it with either an approval or rejection.
thread_config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "some_id"}}
graph.invoke(Command(resume=True), config=thread_config)

API Reference: interrupt | Command
See how to review tool calls for a more detailed example.
Review & Edit State¶

A human can review and edit the state of the graph. This is useful for correcting mistakes or updating the state with additional information.

from langgraph.types import interrupt

def human_editing(state: State):
    ...
    result = interrupt(
        # Interrupt information to surface to the client.
        # Can be any JSON serializable value.
        {
            "task": "Review the output from the LLM and make any necessary edits.",
            "llm_generated_summary": state["llm_generated_summary"]
        }
    )

    # Update the state with the edited text
    return {
        "llm_generated_summary": result["edited_text"] 
    }

# Add the node to the graph in an appropriate location
# and connect it to the relevant nodes.
graph_builder.add_node("human_editing", human_editing)
graph = graph_builder.compile(checkpointer=checkpointer)

...

# After running the graph and hitting the interrupt, the graph will pause.
# Resume it with the edited text.
thread_config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "some_id"}}
graph.invoke(
    Command(resume={"edited_text": "The edited text"}), 
    config=thread_config
)

API Reference: interrupt
See How to wait for user input using interrupt for a more detailed example.
Review Tool Calls¶

A human can review and edit the output from the LLM before proceeding. This is particularly
critical in applications where the tool calls requested by the LLM may be sensitive or require human oversight.

def human_review_node(state) -> Command[Literal["call_llm", "run_tool"]]:
    # This is the value we'll be providing via Command(resume=<human_review>)
    human_review = interrupt(
        {
            "question": "Is this correct?",
            # Surface tool calls for review
            "tool_call": tool_call
        }
    )

    review_action, review_data = human_review

    # Approve the tool call and continue
    if review_action == "continue":
        return Command(goto="run_tool")

    # Modify the tool call manually and then continue
    elif review_action == "update":
        ...
        updated_msg = get_updated_msg(review_data)
        # Remember that to modify an existing message you will need
        # to pass the message with a matching ID.
        return Command(goto="run_tool", update={"messages": [updated_message]})

    # Give natural language feedback, and then pass that back to the agent
    elif review_action == "feedback":
        ...
        feedback_msg = get_feedback_msg(review_data)
        return Command(goto="call_llm", update={"messages": [feedback_msg]})

See how to review tool calls for a more detailed example.
Multi-turn conversation¶

A multi-turn conversation architecture where an agent and human node cycle back and forth until the agent decides to hand off the conversation to another agent or another part of the system.

A multi-turn conversation involves multiple back-and-forth interactions between an agent and a human, which can allow the agent to gather additional information from the human in a conversational manner.
This design pattern is useful in an LLM application consisting of multiple agents. One or more agents may need to carry out multi-turn conversations with a human, where the human provides input or feedback at different stages of the conversation. For simplicity, the agent implementation below is illustrated as a single node, but in reality 
it may be part of a larger graph consisting of multiple nodes and include a conditional edge.
Using a human node per agentSharing human node across multiple agents

In this pattern, each agent has its own human node for collecting user input. 
This can be achieved by either naming the human nodes with unique names (e.g., "human for agent 1", "human for agent 2") or by
using subgraphs where a subgraph contains a human node and an agent node.
from langgraph.types import interrupt

def human_input(state: State):
    human_message = interrupt("human_input")
    return {
        "messages": [
            {
                "role": "human",
                "content": human_message
            }
        ]
    }

def agent(state: State):
    # Agent logic
    ...

graph_builder.add_node("human_input", human_input)
graph_builder.add_edge("human_input", "agent")
graph = graph_builder.compile(checkpointer=checkpointer)

# After running the graph and hitting the interrupt, the graph will pause.
# Resume it with the human's input.
graph.invoke(
    Command(resume="hello!"),
    config=thread_config
)

In this pattern, a single human node is used to collect user input for multiple agents. The active agent is determined from the state, so after human input is collected, the graph can route to the correct agent.
from langgraph.types import interrupt

def human_node(state: MessagesState) -> Command[Literal["agent_1", "agent_2", ...]]:
    """A node for collecting user input."""
    user_input = interrupt(value="Ready for user input.")

    # Determine the **active agent** from the state, so 
    # we can route to the correct agent after collecting input.
    # For example, add a field to the state or use the last active agent.
    # or fill in `name` attribute of AI messages generated by the agents.
    active_agent = ... 

    return Command(
        update={
            "messages": [{
                "role": "human",
                "content": user_input,
            }]
        },
        goto=active_agent,
    )

See how to implement multi-turn conversations for a more detailed example.
Validating human input¶
If you need to validate the input provided by the human within the graph itself (rather than on the client side), you can achieve this by using multiple interrupt calls within a single node.
from langgraph.types import interrupt

def human_node(state: State):
    """Human node with validation."""
    question = "What is your age?"

    while True:
        answer = interrupt(question)

        # Validate answer, if the answer isn't valid ask for input again.
        if not isinstance(answer, int) or answer < 0:
            question = f"'{answer} is not a valid age. What is your age?"
            answer = None
            continue
        else:
            # If the answer is valid, we can proceed.
            break

    print(f"The human in the loop is {answer} years old.")
    return {
        "age": answer
    }

API Reference: interrupt
The Command primitive¶
When using the interrupt function, the graph will pause at the interrupt and wait for user input.
Graph execution can be resumed using the Command primitive which can be passed through the invoke, ainvoke, stream or astream methods.
The Command primitive provides several options to control and modify the graph's state during resumption:

Pass a value to the interrupt: Provide data, such as a user's response, to the graph using Command(resume=value). Execution resumes from the beginning of the node where the interrupt was used, however, this time the interrupt(...) call will return the value passed in the Command(resume=value) instead of pausing the graph.
# Resume graph execution with the user's input.
graph.invoke(Command(resume={"age": "25"}), thread_config)

Update the graph state: Modify the graph state using Command(update=update). Note that resumption starts from the beginning of the node where the interrupt was used. Execution resumes from the beginning of the node where the interrupt was used, but with the updated state.
# Update the graph state and resume.
# You must provide a `resume` value if using an `interrupt`.
graph.invoke(Command(update={"foo": "bar"}, resume="Let's go!!!"), thread_config)

By leveraging Command, you can resume graph execution, handle user inputs, and dynamically adjust the graph's state.
Using with invoke and ainvoke¶
When you use stream or astream to run the graph, you will receive an Interrupt event that let you know the interrupt was triggered. 
invoke and ainvoke do not return the interrupt information. To access this information, you must use the get_state method to retrieve the graph state after calling invoke or ainvoke.
# Run the graph up to the interrupt 
result = graph.invoke(inputs, thread_config)
# Get the graph state to get interrupt information.
state = graph.get_state(thread_config)
# Print the state values
print(state.values)
# Print the pending tasks
print(state.tasks)
# Resume the graph with the user's input.
graph.invoke(Command(resume={"age": "25"}), thread_config)

{'foo': 'bar'} # State values
(
    PregelTask(
        id='5d8ffc92-8011-0c9b-8b59-9d3545b7e553', 
        name='node_foo', 
        path=('__pregel_pull', 'node_foo'), 
        error=None, 
        interrupts=(Interrupt(value='value_in_interrupt', resumable=True, ns=['node_foo:5d8ffc92-8011-0c9b-8b59-9d3545b7e553'], when='during'),), state=None, 
        result=None
    ),
) # Pending tasks. interrupts 

How does resuming from an interrupt work?¶

Warning
Resuming from an interrupt is different from Python's input() function, where execution resumes from the exact point where the input() function was called.

A critical aspect of using interrupt is understanding how resuming works. When you resume execution after an interrupt, graph execution starts from the beginning of the graph node where the last interrupt was triggered.
All code from the beginning of the node to the interrupt will be re-executed.
counter = 0
def node(state: State):
    # All the code from the beginning of the node to the interrupt will be re-executed
    # when the graph resumes.
    global counter
    counter += 1
    print(f"> Entered the node: {counter} # of times")
    # Pause the graph and wait for user input.
    answer = interrupt()
    print("The value of counter is:", counter)
    ...

Upon resuming the graph, the counter will be incremented a second time, resulting in the following output:
> Entered the node: 2 # of times
The value of counter is: 2

Common Pitfalls¶
Side-effects¶
Place code with side effects, such as API calls, after the interrupt to avoid duplication, as these are re-triggered every time the node is resumed. 
Side effects before interrupt (BAD)Side effects after interrupt (OK)Side effects in a separate node (OK)

This code will re-execute the API call another time when the node is resumed from
the interrupt.
This can be problematic if the API call is not idempotent or is just expensive.
from langgraph.types import interrupt

def human_node(state: State):
    """Human node with validation."""
    api_call(...) # This code will be re-executed when the node is resumed.
    answer = interrupt(question)

from langgraph.types import interrupt

def human_node(state: State):
    """Human node with validation."""

    answer = interrupt(question)

    api_call(answer) # OK as it's after the interrupt

from langgraph.types import interrupt

def human_node(state: State):
    """Human node with validation."""

    answer = interrupt(question)

    return {
        "answer": answer
    }

def api_call_node(state: State):
    api_call(...) # OK as it's in a separate node

Subgraphs called as functions¶
When invoking a subgraph as a function, the parent graph will resume execution from the beginning of the node where the subgraph was invoked (and where an interrupt was triggered). Similarly, the subgraph, will resume from the beginning of the node where the interrupt() function was called.
For example,
def node_in_parent_graph(state: State):
    some_code()  # <-- This will re-execute when the subgraph is resumed.
    # Invoke a subgraph as a function.
    # The subgraph contains an `interrupt` call.
    subgraph_result = subgraph.invoke(some_input)
    ...

Example: Parent and Subgraph Execution Flow
Say we have a parent graph with 3 nodes:
Parent Graph: node_1 → node_2 (subgraph call) → node_3
And the subgraph has 3 nodes, where the second node contains an interrupt:
Subgraph: sub_node_1 → sub_node_2 (interrupt) → sub_node_3
When resuming the graph, the execution will proceed as follows:

Skip node_1 in the parent graph (already executed, graph state was saved in snapshot).
Re-execute node_2 in the parent graph from the start.
Skip sub_node_1 in the subgraph (already executed, graph state was saved in snapshot).
Re-execute sub_node_2 in the subgraph from the beginning.
Continue with sub_node_3 and subsequent nodes.

Here is abbreviated example code that you can use to understand how subgraphs work with interrupts.
  It counts the number of times each node is entered and prints the count.
import uuid
from typing import TypedDict

from langgraph.graph import StateGraph
from langgraph.constants import START
from langgraph.types import interrupt, Command
from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver

class State(TypedDict):
   """The graph state."""
   state_counter: int

counter_node_in_subgraph = 0

def node_in_subgraph(state: State):
   """A node in the sub-graph."""
   global counter_node_in_subgraph
   counter_node_in_subgraph += 1  # This code will **NOT** run again!
   print(f"Entered `node_in_subgraph` a total of {counter_node_in_subgraph} times")

counter_human_node = 0

def human_node(state: State):
   global counter_human_node
   counter_human_node += 1 # This code will run again!
   print(f"Entered human_node in sub-graph a total of {counter_human_node} times")
   answer = interrupt("what is your name?")
   print(f"Got an answer of {answer}")

checkpointer = MemorySaver()

subgraph_builder = StateGraph(State)
subgraph_builder.add_node("some_node", node_in_subgraph)
subgraph_builder.add_node("human_node", human_node)
subgraph_builder.add_edge(START, "some_node")
subgraph_builder.add_edge("some_node", "human_node")
subgraph = subgraph_builder.compile(checkpointer=checkpointer)

counter_parent_node = 0

def parent_node(state: State):
   """This parent node will invoke the subgraph."""
   global counter_parent_node

   counter_parent_node += 1 # This code will run again on resuming!
   print(f"Entered `parent_node` a total of {counter_parent_node} times")

   # Please note that we're intentionally incrementing the state counter
   # in the graph state as well to demonstrate that the subgraph update
   # of the same key will not conflict with the parent graph (until
   subgraph_state = subgraph.invoke(state)
   return subgraph_state

builder = StateGraph(State)
builder.add_node("parent_node", parent_node)
builder.add_edge(START, "parent_node")

# A checkpointer must be enabled for interrupts to work!
checkpointer = MemorySaver()
graph = builder.compile(checkpointer=checkpointer)

config = {
   "configurable": {
      "thread_id": uuid.uuid4(),
   }
}

for chunk in graph.stream({"state_counter": 1}, config):
   print(chunk)

print('--- Resuming ---')

for chunk in graph.stream(Command(resume="35"), config):
   print(chunk)

This will print out
Entered `parent_node` a total of 1 times
Entered `node_in_subgraph` a total of 1 times
Entered human_node in sub-graph a total of 1 times
{'__interrupt__': (Interrupt(value='what is your name?', resumable=True, ns=['parent_node:4c3a0248-21f0-1287-eacf-3002bc304db4', 'human_node:2fe86d52-6f70-2a3f-6b2f-b1eededd6348'], when='during'),)}
--- Resuming ---
Entered `parent_node` a total of 2 times
Entered human_node in sub-graph a total of 2 times
Got an answer of 35
{'parent_node': {'state_counter': 1}}

Using multiple interrupts¶
Using multiple interrupts within a single node can be helpful for patterns like validating human input. However, using multiple interrupts in the same node can lead to unexpected behavior if not handled carefully.
When a node contains multiple interrupt calls, LangGraph keeps a list of resume values specific to the task executing the node. Whenever execution resumes, it starts at the beginning of the node. For each interrupt encountered, LangGraph checks if a matching value exists in the task's resume list. Matching is strictly index-based, so the order of interrupt calls within the node is critical.
To avoid issues, refrain from dynamically changing the node's structure between executions. This includes adding, removing, or reordering interrupt calls, as such changes can result in mismatched indices. These problems often arise from unconventional patterns, such as mutating state via Command(resume=..., update=SOME_STATE_MUTATION) or relying on global variables to modify the node’s structure dynamically.

Example of incorrect code
import uuid
from typing import TypedDict, Optional

from langgraph.graph import StateGraph
from langgraph.constants import START 
from langgraph.types import interrupt, Command
from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver

class State(TypedDict):
    """The graph state."""

    age: Optional[str]
    name: Optional[str]

def human_node(state: State):
    if not state.get('name'):
        name = interrupt("what is your name?")
    else:
        name = "N/A"

    if not state.get('age'):
        age = interrupt("what is your age?")
    else:
        age = "N/A"

    print(f"Name: {name}. Age: {age}")

    return {
        "age": age,
        "name": name,
    }

builder = StateGraph(State)
builder.add_node("human_node", human_node)
builder.add_edge(START, "human_node")

# A checkpointer must be enabled for interrupts to work!
checkpointer = MemorySaver()
graph = builder.compile(checkpointer=checkpointer)

config = {
    "configurable": {
        "thread_id": uuid.uuid4(),
    }
}

for chunk in graph.stream({"age": None, "name": None}, config):
    print(chunk)

for chunk in graph.stream(Command(resume="John", update={"name": "foo"}), config):
    print(chunk)

{'__interrupt__': (Interrupt(value='what is your name?', resumable=True, ns=['human_node:3a007ef9-c30d-c357-1ec1-86a1a70d8fba'], when='during'),)}
Name: N/A. Age: John
{'human_node': {'age': 'John', 'name': 'N/A'}}

Breakpoints¶
Breakpoints pause graph execution at specific points and enable stepping through execution step by step. Breakpoints are powered by LangGraph's persistence layer, which saves the state after each graph step. Breakpoints can also be used to enable human-in-the-loop workflows, though we recommend using the interrupt function for this purpose.
Requirements¶
To use breakpoints, you will need to:

Specify a checkpointer to save the graph state after each step.
Set breakpoints to specify where execution should pause.
Run the graph with a thread ID to pause execution at the breakpoint.
Resume execution using invoke/ainvoke/stream/astream (see The Command primitive).

Setting breakpoints¶
There are two places where you can set breakpoints:

Before or after a node executes by setting breakpoints at compile time or run time. We call these static breakpoints.
Inside a node using the NodeInterrupt exception.

Static breakpoints¶
Static breakpoints are triggered either before or after a node executes. You can set static breakpoints by specifying interrupt_before and interrupt_after at "compile" time or run time.
Compile timeRun time

graph = graph_builder.compile(
    interrupt_before=["node_a"], 
    interrupt_after=["node_b", "node_c"],
    checkpointer=..., # Specify a checkpointer
)

thread_config = {
    "configurable": {
        "thread_id": "some_thread"
    }
}

# Run the graph until the breakpoint
graph.invoke(inputs, config=thread_config)

# Optionally update the graph state based on user input
graph.update_state(update, config=thread_config)

# Resume the graph
graph.invoke(None, config=thread_config)

graph.invoke(
    inputs, 
    config={"configurable": {"thread_id": "some_thread"}}, 
    interrupt_before=["node_a"], 
    interrupt_after=["node_b", "node_c"]
)

thread_config = {
    "configurable": {
        "thread_id": "some_thread"
    }
}

# Run the graph until the breakpoint
graph.invoke(inputs, config=thread_config)

# Optionally update the graph state based on user input
graph.update_state(update, config=thread_config)

# Resume the graph
graph.invoke(None, config=thread_config)

Note
You cannot set static breakpoints at runtime for sub-graphs.
If you have a sub-graph, you must set the breakpoints at compilation time.

Static breakpoints can be especially useful for debugging if you want to step through the graph execution one
node at a time or if you want to pause the graph execution at specific nodes.
NodeInterrupt exception¶
We recommend that you use the interrupt function instead of the NodeInterrupt exception if you're trying to implement
human-in-the-loop workflows. The interrupt function is easier to use and more flexible.

NodeInterrupt exception
The developer can define some condition that must be met for a breakpoint to be triggered. This concept of dynamic breakpoints is useful when the developer wants to halt the graph under a particular condition. This uses a NodeInterrupt, which is a special type of exception that can be raised from within a node based upon some condition. As an example, we can define a dynamic breakpoint that triggers when the input is longer than 5 characters.
def my_node(state: State) -> State:
    if len(state['input']) > 5:
        raise NodeInterrupt(f"Received input that is longer than 5 characters: {state['input']}")

    return state

Let's assume we run the graph with an input that triggers the dynamic breakpoint and then attempt to resume the graph execution simply by passing in None for the input.
# Attempt to continue the graph execution with no change to state after we hit the dynamic breakpoint 
for event in graph.stream(None, thread_config, stream_mode="values"):
    print(event)

The graph will interrupt again because this node will be re-run with the same graph state. We need to change the graph state such that the condition that triggers the dynamic breakpoint is no longer met. So, we can simply edit the graph state to an input that meets the condition of our dynamic breakpoint (< 5 characters) and re-run the node.
# Update the state to pass the dynamic breakpoint
graph.update_state(config=thread_config, values={"input": "foo"})
for event in graph.stream(None, thread_config, stream_mode="values"):
    print(event)

Alternatively, what if we want to keep our current input and skip the node (my_node) that performs the check? To do this, we can simply perform the graph update with as_node="my_node" and pass in None for the values. This will make no update the graph state, but run the update as my_node, effectively skipping the node and bypassing the dynamic breakpoint.
# This update will skip the node `my_node` altogether
graph.update_state(config=thread_config, values=None, as_node="my_node")
for event in graph.stream(None, thread_config, stream_mode="values"):
    print(event)

Time Travel ⏱️¶

Prerequisites
This guide assumes that you are familiar with LangGraph's checkpoints and states. If not, please review the persistence concept first.

When working with non-deterministic systems that make model-based decisions (e.g., agents powered by LLMs), it can be useful to examine their decision-making process in detail:

🤔 Understand Reasoning: Analyze the steps that led to a successful result.
🐞 Debug Mistakes: Identify where and why errors occurred.
🔍 Explore Alternatives: Test different paths to uncover better solutions.

We call these debugging techniques Time Travel, composed of two key actions: Replaying 🔁 and Forking 🔀 .
Replaying¶

Replaying allows us to revisit and reproduce an agent's past actions, up to and including a specific step (checkpoint).
To replay actions before a specific checkpoint, start by retrieving all checkpoints for the thread:
all_checkpoints = []
for state in graph.get_state_history(thread):
    all_checkpoints.append(state)

Each checkpoint has a unique ID. After identifying the desired checkpoint, for instance, xyz, include its ID in the configuration:
config = {'configurable': {'thread_id': '1', 'checkpoint_id': 'xyz'}}
for event in graph.stream(None, config, stream_mode="values"):
    print(event)

The graph replays previously executed steps before the provided checkpoint_id and executes the steps after checkpoint_id (i.e., a new fork), even if they have been executed previously.
Forking¶

Forking allows you to revisit an agent's past actions and explore alternative paths within the graph.
To edit a specific checkpoint, such as xyz, provide its checkpoint_id when updating the graph's state:
config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "1", "checkpoint_id": "xyz"}}
graph.update_state(config, {"state": "updated state"})

This creates a new forked checkpoint, xyz-fork, from which you can continue running the graph:
config = {'configurable': {'thread_id': '1', 'checkpoint_id': 'xyz-fork'}}
for event in graph.stream(None, config, stream_mode="values"):
    print(event)

CONTENT:
Functional API¶
Overview¶
The Functional API allows you to add LangGraph's key features -- persistence, memory, human-in-the-loop, and streaming — to your applications with minimal changes to your existing code.
It is designed to integrate these features into existing code that may use standard language primitives for branching and control flow, such as if statements, for loops, and function calls. Unlike many data orchestration frameworks that require restructuring code into an explicit pipeline or DAG, the Functional API allows you to incorporate these capabilities without enforcing a rigid execution model.  
The Functional API uses two key building blocks:  

@entrypoint – Marks a function as the starting point of a workflow, encapsulating logic and managing execution flow, including handling long-running tasks and interrupts.  
@task – Represents a discrete unit of work, such as an API call or data processing step, that can be executed asynchronously within an entrypoint. Tasks return a future-like object that can be awaited or resolved synchronously.  

This provides a minimal abstraction for building workflows with state management and streaming.

Tip
For users who prefer a more declarative approach, LangGraph's Graph API allows you to define workflows using a Graph paradigm. Both APIs share the same underlying runtime, so you can use them together in the same application.
Please see the Functional API vs. Graph API section for a comparison of the two paradigms.

Example¶
Below we demonstrate a simple application that writes an essay and interrupts to request human review.
from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver
from langgraph.func import entrypoint, task
from langgraph.types import interrupt

@task
def write_essay(topic: str) -> str:
    """Write an essay about the given topic."""
    time.sleep(1) # A placeholder for a long-running task.
    return f"An essay about topic: {topic}"

@entrypoint(checkpointer=MemorySaver())
def workflow(topic: str) -> dict:
    """A simple workflow that writes an essay and asks for a review."""
    essay = write_essay("cat").result()
    is_approved = interrupt({
        # Any json-serializable payload provided to interrupt as argument.
        # It will be surfaced on the client side as an Interrupt when streaming data
        # from the workflow.
        "essay": essay, # The essay we want reviewed.
        # We can add any additional information that we need.
        # For example, introduce a key called "action" with some instructions.
        "action": "Please approve/reject the essay",
    })

    return {
        "essay": essay, # The essay that was generated
        "is_approved": is_approved, # Response from HIL
    }

API Reference: MemorySaver | entrypoint | task | interrupt

Detailed Explanation
This workflow will write an essay about the topic "cat" and then pause to get a review from a human. The workflow can be interrupted for an indefinite amount of time until a review is provided.
When the workflow is resumed, it executes from the very start, but because the result of the write_essay task was already saved, the task result will be loaded from the checkpoint instead of being recomputed.
import time
import uuid

from langgraph.func import entrypoint, task
from langgraph.types import interrupt
from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver

@task
def write_essay(topic: str) -> str:
    """Write an essay about the given topic."""
    time.sleep(1) # This is a placeholder for a long-running task.
    return f"An essay about topic: {topic}"

@entrypoint(checkpointer=MemorySaver())
def workflow(topic: str) -> dict:
    """A simple workflow that writes an essay and asks for a review."""
    essay = write_essay("cat").result()
    is_approved = interrupt({
        # Any json-serializable payload provided to interrupt as argument.
        # It will be surfaced on the client side as an Interrupt when streaming data
        # from the workflow.
        "essay": essay, # The essay we want reviewed.
        # We can add any additional information that we need.
        # For example, introduce a key called "action" with some instructions.
        "action": "Please approve/reject the essay",
    })

    return {
        "essay": essay, # The essay that was generated
        "is_approved": is_approved, # Response from HIL
    }

thread_id = str(uuid.uuid4())

config = {
    "configurable": {
        "thread_id": thread_id
    }
}

for item in workflow.stream("cat", config):
    print(item)

{'write_essay': 'An essay about topic: cat'}
{'__interrupt__': (Interrupt(value={'essay': 'An essay about topic: cat', 'action': 'Please approve/reject the essay'}, resumable=True, ns=['workflow:f7b8508b-21c0-8b4c-5958-4e8de74d2684'], when='during'),)}

An essay has been written and is ready for review. Once the review is provided, we can resume the workflow:
from langgraph.types import Command

# Get review from a user (e.g., via a UI)
# In this case, we're using a bool, but this can be any json-serializable value.
human_review = True

for item in workflow.stream(Command(resume=human_review), config):
    print(item)

{'workflow': {'essay': 'An essay about topic: cat', 'is_approved': False}}

The workflow has been completed and the review has been added to the essay.

Entrypoint¶
The @entrypoint decorator can be used to create a workflow from a function. It encapsulates workflow logic and manages execution flow, including handling long-running tasks and interrupts.
Definition¶
An entrypoint is defined by decorating a function with the @entrypoint decorator. 
The function must accept a single positional argument, which serves as the workflow input. If you need to pass multiple pieces of data, use a dictionary as the input type for the first argument.
Decorating a function with an entrypoint produces a Pregel instance which helps to manage the execution of the workflow (e.g., handles streaming, resumption, and checkpointing).
You will usually want to pass a checkpointer to the @entrypoint decorator to enable persistence and use features like human-in-the-loop.
SyncAsync

from langgraph.func import entrypoint

@entrypoint(checkpointer=checkpointer)
def my_workflow(some_input: dict) -> int:
    # some logic that may involve long-running tasks like API calls,
    # and may be interrupted for human-in-the-loop.
    ...
    return result

from langgraph.func import entrypoint

@entrypoint(checkpointer=checkpointer)
async def my_workflow(some_input: dict) -> int:
    # some logic that may involve long-running tasks like API calls,
    # and may be interrupted for human-in-the-loop
    ...
    return result 

Serialization
The inputs and outputs of entrypoints must be JSON-serializable to support checkpointing. Please see the serialization section for more details.

Injectable Parameters¶
When declaring an entrypoint, you can request access to additional parameters that will be injected automatically at run time. These parameters include:

Parameter
Description

previous
Access the the state associated with the previous checkpoint for the given thread. See state management.

store

Executing¶
Using the @entrypoint yields a Pregel object that can be executed using the invoke, ainvoke, stream, and astream methods.
InvokeAsync InvokeStreamAsync Stream

config = {
    "configurable": {
        "thread_id": "some_thread_id"
    }
}
my_workflow.invoke(some_input, config)  # Wait for the result synchronously

config = {
    "configurable": {
        "thread_id": "some_thread_id"
    }
}
await my_workflow.ainvoke(some_input, config)  # Await result asynchronously

config = {
    "configurable": {
        "thread_id": "some_thread_id"
    }
}

        "thread_id": "some_thread_id"
    }
}

async for chunk in my_workflow.astream(some_input, config):
    print(chunk)

Resuming¶
Resuming an execution after an interrupt can be done by passing a resume value to the Command primitive.

from langgraph.types import Command

config = {
    "configurable": {
        "thread_id": "some_thread_id"
    }

from langgraph.types import Command

config = {
    "configurable": {
        "thread_id": "some_thread_id"
    }
}

await my_workflow.ainvoke(Command(resume=some_resume_value), config)

from langgraph.types import Command

config = {
    "configurable": {
        "thread_id": "some_thread_id"
    }
}

for chunk in my_workflow.stream(Command(resume=some_resume_value), config):
    print(chunk)

from langgraph.types import Command

config = {
    "configurable": {
        "thread_id": "some_thread_id"
    }
}

async for chunk in my_workflow.astream(Command(resume=some_resume_value), config):
    print(chunk)

Resuming after an error
To resume after an error, run the entrypoint with a None and the same thread id (config).
This assumes that the underlying error has been resolved and execution can proceed successfully.
InvokeAsync InvokeStreamAsync Stream

config = {
    "configurable": {
        "thread_id": "some_thread_id"
    }
}

my_workflow.invoke(None, config)

config = {
    "configurable": {
        "thread_id": "some_thread_id"
    }
}

await my_workflow.ainvoke(None, config)

config = {
    "configurable": {
        "thread_id": "some_thread_id"
    }
}

for chunk in my_workflow.stream(None, config):
    print(chunk)

config = {
    "configurable": {
        "thread_id": "some_thread_id"
    }
}

async for chunk in my_workflow.astream(None, config):
    print(chunk)

State Management¶
When an entrypoint is defined with a checkpointer, it stores information between successive invocations on the same thread id in checkpoints. 
This allows accessing the state from the previous invocation using the previous parameter.
By default, the previous parameter is the return value of the previous invocation.
@entrypoint(checkpointer=checkpointer)
def my_workflow(number: int, *, previous: Any = None) -> int:
    previous = previous or 0
    return number + previous

config = {
    "configurable": {
        "thread_id": "some_thread_id"
    }
}

my_workflow.invoke(1, config)  # 1 (previous was None)
my_workflow.invoke(2, config)  # 3 (previous was 1 from the previous invocation)

entrypoint.final¶
entrypoint.final is a special primitive that can be returned from an entrypoint and allows decoupling the value that is saved in the checkpoint from the return value of the entrypoint.
The first value is the return value of the entrypoint, and the second value is the value that will be saved in the checkpoint. The type annotation is entrypoint.final[return_type, save_type].
@entrypoint(checkpointer=checkpointer)
def my_workflow(number: int, *, previous: Any = None) -> entrypoint.final[int, int]:
    previous = previous or 0
    # This will return the previous value to the caller, saving
    # 2 * number to the checkpoint, which will be used in the next invocation 
    # for the `previous` parameter.
    return entrypoint.final(value=previous, save=2 * number)

config = {
    "configurable": {
        "thread_id": "1"
    }
}

my_workflow.invoke(3, config)  # 0 (previous was None)
my_workflow.invoke(1, config)  # 6 (previous was 3 * 2 from the previous invocation)

Task¶
A task represents a discrete unit of work, such as an API call or data processing step. It has two key characteristics:

Asynchronous Execution: Tasks are designed to be executed asynchronously, allowing multiple operations to run concurrently without blocking.
Checkpointing: Task results are saved to a checkpoint, enabling resumption of the workflow from the last saved state. (See persistence for more details).

Definition¶
Tasks are defined using the @task decorator, which wraps a regular Python function.
from langgraph.func import task

@task()
def slow_computation(input_value):
    # Simulate a long-running operation
    ...
    return result

API Reference: task

Serialization
The outputs of tasks must be JSON-serializable to support checkpointing.

Execution¶
Tasks can only be called from within an entrypoint, another task, or a state graph node. 
Tasks cannot be called directly from the main application code. 
When you call a task, it returns immediately with a future object. A future is a placeholder for a result that will be available later.
To obtain the result of a task, you can either wait for it synchronously (using result()) or await it asynchronously (using await).
Synchronous InvocationAsynchronous Invocation

@entrypoint(checkpointer=checkpointer)
def my_workflow(some_input: int) -> int:
    future = slow_computation(some_input)
    return future.result()  # Wait for the result synchronously

@entrypoint(checkpointer=checkpointer)
async def my_workflow(some_input: int) -> int:
    return await slow_computation(some_input)  # Await result asynchronously

When to use a task¶
Tasks are useful in the following scenarios:

Checkpointing: When you need to save the result of a long-running operation to a checkpoint, so you don't need to recompute it when resuming the workflow.
Human-in-the-loop: If you're building a workflow that requires human intervention, you MUST use tasks to encapsulate any randomness (e.g., API calls) to ensure that the workflow can be resumed correctly. See the determinism section for more details.
Parallel Execution: For I/O-bound tasks, tasks enable parallel execution, allowing multiple operations to run concurrently without blocking (e.g., calling multiple APIs).
Observability: Wrapping operations in tasks provides a way to track the progress of the workflow and monitor the execution of individual operations using LangSmith.
Retryable Work: When work needs to be retried to handle failures or inconsistencies, tasks provide a way to encapsulate and manage the retry logic.

Serialization¶
There are two key aspects to serialization in LangGraph:

@entrypoint inputs and outputs must be JSON-serializable.
@task outputs must be JSON-serializable.

These requirements are necessary for enabling checkpointing and workflow resumption. Use python primitives
like dictionaries, lists, strings, numbers, and booleans to ensure that your inputs and outputs are serializable.
Serialization ensures that workflow state, such as task results and intermediate values, can be reliably saved and restored. This is critical for enabling human-in-the-loop interactions, fault tolerance, and parallel execution.
Providing non-serializable inputs or outputs will result in a runtime error when a workflow is configured with a checkpointer.
Determinism¶
To utilize features like human-in-the-loop, any randomness should be encapsulated inside of tasks. This guarantees that when execution is halted (e.g., for human in the loop) and then resumed, it will follow the same sequence of steps, even if task results are non-deterministic.
LangGraph achieves this behavior by persisting task and subgraph results as they execute. A well-designed workflow ensures that resuming execution follows the same sequence of steps, allowing previously computed results to be retrieved correctly without having to re-execute them. This is particularly useful for long-running tasks or tasks with non-deterministic results, as it avoids repeating previously done work and allows resuming from essentially the same 
While different runs of a workflow can produce different results, resuming a specific run should always follow the same sequence of recorded steps. This allows LangGraph to efficiently look up task and subgraph results that were executed prior to the graph being interrupted and avoid recomputing them.
Idempotency¶
Idempotency ensures that running the same operation multiple times produces the same result. This helps prevent duplicate API calls and redundant processing if a step is rerun due to a failure. Always place API calls inside tasks functions for checkpointing, and design them to be idempotent in case of re-execution. Re-execution can occur if a task starts, but does not complete successfully. Then, if the workflow is resumed, the task will run again. Use idempotency keys or verify existing results to avoid duplication.
Functional API vs. Graph API¶
The Functional API and the Graph APIs (StateGraph) provide two different paradigms to create applications with LangGraph. Here are some key differences:

Control flow: The Functional API does not require thinking about graph structure. You can use standard Python constructs to define workflows. This will usually trim the amount of code you need to write.
State management: The GraphAPI requires declaring a State and may require defining reducers to manage updates to the graph state. @entrypoint and @tasks do not require explicit state management as their state is scoped to the function and is not shared across functions.
Checkpointing: Both APIs generate and use checkpoints. In the Graph API a new checkpoint is generated after every superstep. In the Functional API, when tasks are executed, their results are saved to an existing checkpoint associated with the given entrypoint instead of creating a new checkpoint.
Visualization: The Graph API makes it easy to visualize the workflow as a graph which can be useful for debugging, understanding the workflow, and sharing with others. The Functional API does not support visualization as the graph is dynamically generated during runtime.

Common Pitfalls¶
Handling side effects¶
Encapsulate side effects (e.g., writing to a file, sending an email) in tasks to ensure they are not executed multiple times when resuming a workflow.
IncorrectCorrect

In this example, a side effect (writing to a file) is directly included in the workflow, so it will be executed a second time when resuming the workflow.
@entrypoint(checkpointer=checkpointer)
def my_workflow(inputs: dict) -> int:
    # This code will be executed a second time when resuming the workflow.
    # Which is likely not what you want.
    with open("output.txt", "w") as f:
        f.write("Side effect executed")
    value = interrupt("question")
    return value

In this example, the side effect is encapsulated in a task, ensuring consistent execution upon resumption.
from langgraph.func import task

@task
def write_to_file():
    with open("output.txt", "w") as f:
        f.write("Side effect executed")

@entrypoint(checkpointer=checkpointer)
def my_workflow(inputs: dict) -> int:
    # The side effect is now encapsulated in a task.
    write_to_file().result()
    value = interrupt("question")
    return value

Non-deterministic control flow¶
Operations that might give different results each time (like getting current time or random numbers) should be encapsulated in tasks to ensure that on resume, the same result is returned.

In a task: Get random number (5) → interrupt → resume → (returns 5 again) → ...
Not in a task: Get random number (5) → interrupt → resume → get new random number (7) → ...

This is especially important when using human-in-the-loop workflows with multiple interrupts calls. LangGraph keeps a list
of resume values for each task/entrypoint. When an interrupt is encountered, it's matched with the corresponding resume value.
This matching is strictly index-based, so the order of the resume values should match the order of the interrupts.
If order of execution is not maintained when resuming, one interrupt call may be matched with the wrong resume value, leading to incorrect results.
Please read the section on determinism for more details.
IncorrectCorrect

In this example, the workflow uses the current time to determine which task to execute. This is non-deterministic because the result of the workflow depends on the time at which it is executed.
from langgraph.func import entrypoint

@entrypoint(checkpointer=checkpointer)
def my_workflow(inputs: dict) -> int:
    t0 = inputs["t0"]
    t1 = time.time()

    delta_t = t1 - t0

    if delta_t > 1:
        result = slow_task(1).result()
        value = interrupt("question")
    else:
        result = slow_task(2).result()
        value = interrupt("question")

    return {
        "result": result,
        "value": value
    }

In this example, the workflow uses the input t0 to determine which task to execute. This is deterministic because the result of the workflow depends only on the input.
import time

from langgraph.func import task

@task
def get_time() -> float:
    return time.time()

@entrypoint(checkpointer=checkpointer)
def my_workflow(inputs: dict) -> int:
    t0 = inputs["t0"]
    t1 = get_time().result()

    delta_t = t1 - t0

    if delta_t > 1:
        result = slow_task(1).result()
        value = interrupt("question")
    else:
        result = slow_task(2).result()
        value = interrupt("question")

    return {
        "result": result,
        "value": value
    }

Patterns¶
Below are a few simple patterns that show examples of how to use the Functional API.
When defining an entrypoint, input is restricted to the first argument of the function. To pass multiple inputs, you can use a dictionary.
@entrypoint(checkpointer=checkpointer)
def my_workflow(inputs: dict) -> int:
    value = inputs["value"]
    another_value = inputs["another_value"]
    ...

my_workflow.invoke({"value": 1, "another_value": 2})  

Parallel execution¶
Tasks can be executed in parallel by invoking them concurrently and waiting for the results. This is useful for improving performance in IO bound tasks (e.g., calling APIs for LLMs).
@task
def add_one(number: int) -> int:
    return number + 1

@entrypoint(checkpointer=checkpointer)
def graph(numbers: list[int]) -> list[str]:
    futures = [add_one(i) for i in numbers]
    return [f.result() for f in futures]

Calling subgraphs¶
The Functional API and the Graph API can be used together in the same application as they share the same underlying runtime.
from langgraph.func import entrypoint
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph

builder = StateGraph()
...
some_graph = builder.compile()

@entrypoint()
def some_workflow(some_input: dict) -> int:
    # Call a graph defined using the graph API
    result_1 = some_graph.invoke(...)
    # Call another graph defined using the graph API
    result_2 = another_graph.invoke(...)
    return {
        "result_1": result_1,
        "result_2": result_2
    }

API Reference: entrypoint | StateGraph
Calling other entrypoints¶
You can call other entrypoints from within an entrypoint or a task.
@entrypoint() # Will automatically use the checkpointer from the parent entrypoint
def some_other_workflow(inputs: dict) -> int:
    return inputs["value"]

@entrypoint(checkpointer=checkpointer)
def my_workflow(inputs: dict) -> int:
    value = some_other_workflow.invoke({"value": 1})
    return value

Streaming custom data¶
You can stream custom data from an entrypoint by using the StreamWriter type. This allows you to write custom data to the custom stream.
from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver
from langgraph.func import entrypoint, task
from langgraph.types import StreamWriter

@task
def add_one(x):
    return x + 1

@task
def add_two(x):
    return x + 2

checkpointer = MemorySaver()

@entrypoint(checkpointer=checkpointer)
def main(inputs, writer: StreamWriter) -> int:
    """A simple workflow that adds one and two to a number."""
    writer("hello") # Write some data to the `custom` stream
    add_one(inputs['number']).result() # Will write data to the `updates` stream
    writer("world") # Write some more data to the `custom` stream
    add_two(inputs['number']).result() # Will write data to the `updates` stream
    return 5 

config = {
    "configurable": {
        "thread_id": "1"
    }
}

for chunk in main.stream({"number": 1}, stream_mode=["custom", "updates"], config=config):
    print(chunk)

API Reference: MemorySaver | entrypoint | task | StreamWriter
('updates', {'add_one': 2})
('updates', {'add_two': 3})
('custom', 'hello')
('custom', 'world')
('updates', {'main': 5})

Important
The writer parameter is automatically injected at run time. It will only be injected if the 
parameter name appears in the function signature with that exact name.

Retry policy¶
from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver
from langgraph.func import entrypoint, task
from langgraph.types import RetryPolicy

attempts = 0

# Let's configure the RetryPolicy to retry on ValueError.
# The default RetryPolicy is optimized for retrying specific network errors.
retry_policy = RetryPolicy(retry_on=ValueError)

@task(retry=retry_policy) 
def get_info():
    global attempts
    attempts += 1

    if attempts < 2:
        raise ValueError('Failure')
    return "OK"

checkpointer = MemorySaver()

@entrypoint(checkpointer=checkpointer)
def main(inputs, writer):
    return get_info().result()

config = {
    "configurable": {
        "thread_id": "1"
    }
}

main.invoke({'any_input': 'foobar'}, config=config)

API Reference: MemorySaver | entrypoint | task | RetryPolicy
'OK'

Resuming after an error¶
import time
from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver
from langgraph.func import entrypoint, task
from langgraph.types import StreamWriter

# This variable is just used for demonstration purposes to simulate a network failure.
# It's not something you will have in your actual code.
attempts = 0

@task()
def get_info():
    """
    Simulates a task that fails once before succeeding.
    Raises an exception on the first attempt, then returns "OK" on subsequent tries.
    """
    global attempts
    attempts += 1

    if attempts < 2:
        raise ValueError("Failure")  # Simulate a failure on the first attempt
    return "OK"

# Initialize an in-memory checkpointer for persistence
checkpointer = MemorySaver()

@task
def slow_task():
    """
    Simulates a slow-running task by introducing a 1-second delay.
    """
    time.sleep(1)
    return "Ran slow task."

def main(inputs, writer: StreamWriter):
    """

LangGraph's Runtime (Pregel)¶
Pregel implements LangGraph's runtime, managing the execution of LangGraph applications.
Compiling a StateGraph or creating an entrypoint produces a Pregel instance that can be invoked with input.
This guide explains the runtime at a high level and provides instructions for directly implementing applications with Pregel.

Note: The Pregel runtime is named after Google's Pregel algorithm, which describes an efficient method for large-scale parallel computation using graphs.

Overview¶
In LangGraph, Pregel combines actors and channels into a single application. Actors read data from channels and write data to channels. Pregel organizes the execution of the application into multiple steps, following the Pregel Algorithm/Bulk Synchronous Parallel model.
Each step consists of three phases:

Plan: Determine which actors to execute in this step. For example, in the first step, select the actors that subscribe to the special input channels; in subsequent steps, select the actors that subscribe to channels updated in the previous step.
Execution: Execute all selected actors in parallel, until all complete, or one fails, or a timeout is reached. During this phase, channel updates are invisible to actors until the next step.
Update: Update the channels with the values written by the actors in this step.

Repeat until no actors are selected for execution, or a maximum number of steps is reached.
Actors¶
An actor is a PregelNode. It subscribes to channels, reads data from them, and writes data to them. It can be thought of as an actor in the Pregel algorithm. PregelNodes implement LangChain's Runnable interface.
Channels¶
Channels are used to communicate between actors (PregelNodes). Each channel has a value type, an update type, and an update function – which takes a sequence of updates and modifies the stored value. Channels can be used to send data from one chain to another, or to send data from a chain to itself in a future step. LangGraph provides a number of built-in channels:
Basic channels: LastValue and Topic¶

LastValue: The default channel, stores the last value sent to the channel, useful for input and output values, or for sending data from one step to the next.
Topic: A configurable PubSub Topic, useful for sending multiple values between actors, or for accumulating output. Can be configured to deduplicate values or to accumulate values over the course of multiple steps.

Advanced channels: Context and BinaryOperatorAggregate¶

Context: exposes the value of a context manager, managing its lifecycle. Useful for accessing external resources that require setup and/or teardown; e.g., client = Context(httpx.Client).
BinaryOperatorAggregate: stores a persistent value, updated by applying a binary operator to the current value and each update sent to the channel, useful for computing aggregates over multiple steps; e.g.,total = BinaryOperatorAggregate(int, operator.add)

Examples¶
While most users will interact with Pregel through the StateGraph API or 
the entrypoint decorator, it is possible to interact with Pregel directly.
Below are a few different examples to give you a sense of the Pregel API.

)

node2 = (
    Channel.subscribe_to("b")
    | (lambda x: x + x)
    | {
        "c": Channel.write_to("c"),
    }
)

app = Pregel(
    nodes={"node1": node1, "node2": node2},
    channels={
        "a": EphemeralValue(str),
        "b": EphemeralValue(str),
        "c": Topic(str, accumulate=True),
    },
    input_channels=["a"],
    output_channels=["c"],
)

app.invoke({"a": "foo"})

{'c': ['foofoo', 'foofoofoofoo']}

This examples demonstrates how to use the BinaryOperatorAggregate channel to implement a reducer.
from langgraph.channels import EphemeralValue, BinaryOperatorAggregate
from langgraph.pregel import Pregel, Channel

node1 = (
    Channel.subscribe_to("a")
    | (lambda x: x + x)
    | {
        "b": Channel.write_to("b"),
        "c": Channel.write_to("c")
    }
)

node2 = (
    Channel.subscribe_to("b")
    | (lambda x: x + x)
    | {
        "c": Channel.write_to("c"),
    }
)

def reducer(current, update):
    if current:
        return current + " | " + "update"
    else:
        return update

app = Pregel(
    nodes={"node1": node1, "node2": node2},
    channels={
        "a": EphemeralValue(str),
        "b": EphemeralValue(str),
        "c": BinaryOperatorAggregate(str, operator=reducer),
    },
    input_channels=["a"],
    output_channels=["c"],
)

app.invoke({"a": "foo"})

This example demonstrates how to introduce a cycle in the graph, by having
a chain write to a channel it subscribes to. Execution will continue
until a None value is written to the channel.
from langgraph.channels import EphemeralValue
from langgraph.pregel import Pregel, Channel, ChannelWrite, ChannelWriteEntry

example_node = (
    Channel.subscribe_to("value")
    | (lambda x: x + x if len(x) < 10 else None)
    | ChannelWrite(writes=[ChannelWriteEntry(channel="value", skip_none=True)])
)

app = Pregel(
    nodes={"example_node": example_node},
    channels={
        "value": EphemeralValue(str),
    },
    input_channels=["value"],
    output_channels=["value"],
)

app.invoke({"value": "a"})

{'value': 'aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa'}

High-level API¶
LangGraph provides two high-level APIs for creating a Pregel application: the StateGraph (Graph API) and the Functional API.
StateGraph (Graph API)Functional API

The StateGraph (Graph API) is a higher-level abstraction that simplifies the creation of Pregel applications. It allows you to define a graph of nodes and edges. When you compile the graph, the StateGraph API automatically creates the Pregel application for you.
from typing import TypedDict, Optional

from langgraph.constants import START
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph

class Essay(TypedDict):
    topic: str
    content: Optional[str]
    score: Optional[float]

def write_essay(essay: Essay):
    return {
        "content": f"Essay about {essay['topic']}",
    }

def score_essay(essay: Essay):
    return {
        "score": 10
    }

builder = StateGraph(Essay)
builder.add_node(write_essay)
builder.add_node(score_essay)
builder.add_edge(START, "write_essay")

# Compile the graph. 
# This will return a Pregel instance.
graph = builder.compile()

The compiled Pregel instance will be associated with a list of nodes and channels. You can inspect the nodes and channels by printing them.
print(graph.nodes)

You will see something like this:
{'__start__': <langgraph.pregel.read.PregelNode at 0x7d05e3ba1810>,
 'write_essay': <langgraph.pregel.read.PregelNode at 0x7d05e3ba14d0>,
 'score_essay': <langgraph.pregel.read.PregelNode at 0x7d05e3ba1710>}

print(graph.channels)

You should see something like this
{'topic': <langgraph.channels.last_value.LastValue at 0x7d05e3294d80>,
 'content': <langgraph.channels.last_value.LastValue at 0x7d05e3295040>,
 'score': <langgraph.channels.last_value.LastValue at 0x7d05e3295980>,
 '__start__': <langgraph.channels.ephemeral_value.EphemeralValue at 0x7d05e3297e00>,
 'write_essay': <langgraph.channels.ephemeral_value.EphemeralValue at 0x7d05e32960c0>,
 'score_essay': <langgraph.channels.ephemeral_value.EphemeralValue at 0x7d05e2d8ab80>,
 'branch:__start__:__self__:write_essay': <langgraph.channels.ephemeral_value.EphemeralValue at 0x7d05e32941c0>,
 'branch:__start__:__self__:score_essay': <langgraph.channels.ephemeral_value.EphemeralValue at 0x7d05e2d88800>,
 'branch:write_essay:__self__:write_essay': <langgraph.channels.ephemeral_value.EphemeralValue at 0x7d05e3295ec0>,
 'branch:write_essay:__self__:score_essay': <langgraph.channels.ephemeral_value.EphemeralValue at 0x7d05e2d8ac00>,
 'branch:score_essay:__self__:write_essay': <langgraph.channels.ephemeral_value.EphemeralValue at 0x7d05e2d89700>,
 'branch:score_essay:__self__:score_essay': <langgraph.channels.ephemeral_value.EphemeralValue at 0x7d05e2d8b400>,
 'start:write_essay': <langgraph.channels.ephemeral_value.EphemeralValue at 0x7d05e2d8b280>}

In the Functional API, you can use an entrypoint to create
a Pregel application. The entrypoint decorator allows you to define a function that takes input and returns output. 
from typing import TypedDict, Optional

from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import InMemorySaver
from langgraph.func import entrypoint

class Essay(TypedDict):
    topic: str
    content: Optional[str]
    score: Optional[float]

checkpointer = InMemorySaver()

@entrypoint(checkpointer=checkpointer)
def write_essay(essay: Essay):
    return {
        "content": f"Essay about {essay['topic']}",
    }

print("Nodes: ")
print(write_essay.nodes)
print("Channels: ")
print(write_essay.channels)

Nodes: 
{'write_essay': <langgraph.pregel.read.PregelNode object at 0x7d05e2f9aad0>}
Channels: 
{'__start__': <langgraph.channels.ephemeral_value.EphemeralValue object at 0x7d05e2c906c0>, '__end__': <langgraph.channels.last_value.LastValue object at 0x7d05e2c90c40>, '__previous__': <langgraph.channels.last_value.LastValue object at 0x7d05e1007280>}

Streaming¶
Building a responsive app for end-users? Real-time updates are key to keeping users engaged as your app progresses.
There are three main types of data you’ll want to stream:

Workflow progress (e.g., get state updates after each graph node is executed).
LLM tokens as they’re generated.
Custom updates (e.g., "Fetched 10/100 records").

Streaming graph outputs (.stream and .astream)¶
.stream and .astream are sync and async methods for streaming back outputs from a graph run.
There are several different modes you can specify when calling these methods (e.g. `graph.stream(..., mode="...")):

"values": This streams the full value of the state after each step of the graph.
"updates": This streams the updates to the state after each step of the graph. If multiple updates are made in the same step (e.g. multiple nodes are run) then those updates are streamed separately.
"custom": This streams custom data from inside your graph nodes.
"messages": This streams LLM tokens and metadata for the graph node where LLM is invoked.
"debug": This streams as much information as possible throughout the execution of the graph.

You can also specify multiple streaming modes at the same time by passing them as a list. When you do this, the streamed outputs will be tuples (stream_mode, data). For example:
graph.stream(..., stream_mode=["updates", "messages"])

...
('messages', (AIMessageChunk(content='Hi'), {'langgraph_step': 3, 'langgraph_node': 'agent', ...}))
...
('updates', {'agent': {'messages': [AIMessage(content="Hi, how can I help you?")]}})

The below visualization shows the difference between the values and updates modes:

LangGraph Platform¶
Streaming is critical for making LLM applications feel responsive to end users. When creating a streaming run, the streaming mode determines what data is streamed back to the API client. LangGraph Platform supports five streaming modes:

values: Stream the full state of the graph after each super-step is executed. See the how-to guide for streaming values.
messages-tuple: Stream LLM tokens for any messages generated inside a node. This mode is primarily meant for powering chat applications. See the how-to guide for streaming messages.
updates: Streams updates to the state of the graph after each node is executed. See the how-to guide for streaming updates.
debug: Stream debug events throughout graph execution. See the how-to guide for streaming debug events.
events: Stream all events (including the state of the graph) that occur during graph execution. See the how-to guide for streaming events. This mode is only useful for users migrating large LCEL applications to LangGraph. Generally, this mode is not necessary for most applications.

You can also specify multiple streaming modes at the same time. See the how-to guide for configuring multiple streaming modes at the same time.
See the API reference for how to create streaming runs.
Streaming modes values, updates, messages-tuple and debug are very similar to modes available in the LangGraph library - for a deeper conceptual explanation of those, you can see the previous section.
Streaming mode events is the same as using .astream_events in the LangGraph library - for a deeper conceptual explanation of this, you can see the previous section.
All events emitted have two attributes:

event: This is the name of the event
data: This is data associated with the event

DOCUMENT 32
SOURCE: https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/multi_agent/
CONTENT:
Multi-agent Systems¶
An agent is a system that uses an LLM to decide the control flow of an application. As you develop these systems, they might grow more complex over time, making them harder to manage and scale. For example, you might run into the following problems:

agent has too many tools at its disposal and makes poor decisions about which tool to call next
context grows too complex for a single agent to keep track of
there is a need for multiple specialization areas in the system (e.g. planner, researcher, math expert, etc.)

To tackle these, you might consider breaking your application into multiple smaller, independent agents and composing them into a multi-agent system. These independent agents can be as simple as a prompt and an LLM call, or as complex as a ReAct agent (and more!).
The primary benefits of using multi-agent systems are:

Modularity: Separate agents make it easier to develop, test, and maintain agentic systems.
Specialization: You can create expert agents focused on specific domains, which helps with the overall system performance.
Control: You can explicitly control how agents communicate (as opposed to relying on function calling).

Multi-agent architectures¶

There are several ways to connect agents in a multi-agent system:

Network: each agent can communicate with every other agent. Any agent can decide which other agent to call next.
Supervisor: each agent communicates with a single supervisor agent. Supervisor agent makes decisions on which agent should be called next.
Supervisor (tool-calling): this is a special case of supervisor architecture. Individual agents can be represented as tools. In this case, a supervisor agent uses a tool-calling LLM to decide which of the agent tools to call, as well as the arguments to pass to those agents.
Hierarchical: you can define a multi-agent system with a supervisor of supervisors. This is a generalization of the supervisor architecture and allows for more complex control flows.
Custom multi-agent workflow: each agent communicates with only a subset of agents. Parts of the flow are deterministic, and only some agents can decide which other agents to call next.

Handoffs¶
In multi-agent architectures, agents can be represented as graph nodes. Each agent node executes its step(s) and decides whether to finish execution or route to another agent, including potentially routing to itself (e.g., running in a loop). A common pattern in multi-agent interactions is handoffs, where one agent hands off control to another. Handoffs allow you to specify:

destination: target agent to navigate to (e.g., name of the node to go to)
payload: information to pass to that agent (e.g., state update)

To implement handoffs in LangGraph, agent nodes can return Command object that allows you to combine both control flow and state updates:
def agent(state) -> Command[Literal["agent", "another_agent"]]:
    # the condition for routing/halting can be anything, e.g. LLM tool call / structured output, etc.
    goto = get_next_agent(...)  # 'agent' / 'another_agent'
    return Command(
        # Specify which agent to call next
        goto=goto,
        # Update the graph state
        update={"my_state_key": "my_state_value"}
    )

In a more complex scenario where each agent node is itself a graph (i.e., a subgraph), a node in one of the agent subgraphs might want to navigate to a different agent. For example, if you have two agents, alice and bob (subgraph nodes in a parent graph), and alice needs to navigate to bob, you can set graph=Command.PARENT in the Command object:
def some_node_inside_alice(state):
    return Command(
        goto="bob",
        update={"my_state_key": "my_state_value"},
        # specify which graph to navigate to (defaults to the current graph)
        graph=Command.PARENT,
    )

Note
If you need to support visualization for subgraphs communicating using Command(graph=Command.PARENT) you would need to wrap them in a node function with Command annotation, e.g. instead of this:
builder.add_node(alice)

you would need to do this:
def call_alice(state) -> Command[Literal["bob"]]:
    return alice.invoke(state)

builder.add_node("alice", call_alice)

Handoffs as tools¶
One of the most common agent types is a ReAct-style tool-calling agents. For those types of agents, a common pattern is wrapping a handoff in a tool call, e.g.:
def transfer_to_bob(state):
    """Transfer to bob."""
    return Command(
        goto="bob",
        update={"my_state_key": "my_state_value"},
        graph=Command.PARENT,
    )

This is a special case of updating the graph state from tools where, in addition to the state update, the control flow is included as well.

Important
If you want to use tools that return Command, you can either use prebuilt create_react_agent / ToolNode components, or implement your own tool-executing node that collects Command objects returned by the tools and returns a list of them, e.g.:
def call_tools(state):
    ...
    commands = [tools_by_name[tool_call["name"]].invoke(tool_call) for tool_call in tool_calls]
    return commands

Let's now take a closer look at the different multi-agent architectures.
Network¶
In this architecture, agents are defined as graph nodes. Each agent can communicate with every other agent (many-to-many connections) and can decide which agent to call next. This architecture is good for problems that do not have a clear hierarchy of agents or a specific sequence in which agents should be called.
from typing import Literal
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from langgraph.types import Command
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, MessagesState, START, END

model = ChatOpenAI()

def agent_1(state: MessagesState) -> Command[Literal["agent_2", "agent_3", END]]:
    # you can pass relevant parts of the state to the LLM (e.g., state["messages"])
    # to determine which agent to call next. a common pattern is to call the model
    # with a structured output (e.g. force it to return an output with a "next_agent" field)
    response = model.invoke(...)
    # route to one of the agents or exit based on the LLM's decision
    # if the LLM returns "__end__", the graph will finish execution
    return Command(
        goto=response["next_agent"],
        update={"messages": [response["content"]]},
    )

def agent_2(state: MessagesState) -> Command[Literal["agent_1", "agent_3", END]]:
    response = model.invoke(...)
    return Command(
        goto=response["next_agent"],
        update={"messages": [response["content"]]},
    )

def agent_3(state: MessagesState) -> Command[Literal["agent_1", "agent_2", END]]:
    ...
    return Command(
        goto=response["next_agent"],

    )

builder = StateGraph(MessagesState)
builder.add_node(agent_1)
builder.add_node(agent_2)
builder.add_node(agent_3)

builder.add_edge(START, "agent_1")
network = builder.compile()

API Reference: ChatOpenAI | Command | StateGraph | START | END
Supervisor¶
In this architecture, we define agents as nodes and add a supervisor node (LLM) that decides which agent nodes should be called next. We use Command to route execution to the appropriate agent node based on supervisor's decision. This architecture also lends itself well to running multiple agents in parallel or using map-reduce pattern.
from typing import Literal
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from langgraph.types import Command
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, MessagesState, START, END

model = ChatOpenAI()

def supervisor(state: MessagesState) -> Command[Literal["agent_1", "agent_2", END]]:
    # you can pass relevant parts of the state to the LLM (e.g., state["messages"])
    # to determine which agent to call next. a common pattern is to call the model
    # with a structured output (e.g. force it to return an output with a "next_agent" field)
    response = model.invoke(...)
    # route to one of the agents or exit based on the supervisor's decision
    # if the supervisor returns "__end__", the graph will finish execution
    return Command(goto=response["next_agent"])

def agent_1(state: MessagesState) -> Command[Literal["supervisor"]]:
    # you can pass relevant parts of the state to the LLM (e.g., state["messages"])
    # and add any additional logic (different models, custom prompts, structured output, etc.)
    response = model.invoke(...)
    return Command(
        goto="supervisor",
        update={"messages": [response]},
    )

def agent_2(state: MessagesState) -> Command[Literal["supervisor"]]:
    response = model.invoke(...)
    return Command(
        goto="supervisor",
        update={"messages": [response]},
    )

builder = StateGraph(MessagesState)
builder.add_node(supervisor)
builder.add_node(agent_1)
builder.add_node(agent_2)

builder.add_edge(START, "supervisor")

supervisor = builder.compile()

API Reference: ChatOpenAI | Command | StateGraph | START | END
Check out this tutorial for an example of supervisor multi-agent architecture.
Supervisor (tool-calling)¶
In this variant of the supervisor architecture, we define individual agents as tools and use a tool-calling LLM in the supervisor node. This can be implemented as a ReAct-style agent with two nodes — an LLM node (supervisor) and a tool-calling node that executes tools (agents in this case).
from typing import Annotated
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from langgraph.prebuilt import InjectedState, create_react_agent

model = ChatOpenAI()

# this is the agent function that will be called as tool
# notice that you can pass the state to the tool via InjectedState annotation
def agent_1(state: Annotated[dict, InjectedState]):
    # you can pass relevant parts of the state to the LLM (e.g., state["messages"])
    # and add any additional logic (different models, custom prompts, structured output, etc.)
    response = model.invoke(...)
    # return the LLM response as a string (expected tool response format)
    # this will be automatically turned to ToolMessage
    # by the prebuilt create_react_agent (supervisor)
    return response.content

def agent_2(state: Annotated[dict, InjectedState]):
    response = model.invoke(...)
    return response.content

tools = [agent_1, agent_2]
# the simplest way to build a supervisor w/ tool-calling is to use prebuilt ReAct agent graph
# that consists of a tool-calling LLM node (i.e. supervisor) and a tool-executing node
supervisor = create_react_agent(model, tools)

API Reference: ChatOpenAI | InjectedState | create_react_agent
Hierarchical¶
As you add more agents to your system, it might become too hard for the supervisor to manage all of them. The supervisor might start making poor decisions about which agent to call next, or the context might become too complex for a single supervisor to keep track of. In other words, you end up with the same problems that motivated the multi-agent architecture in the first place.
To address this, you can design your system hierarchically. For example, you can create separate, specialized teams of agents managed by individual supervisors, and a top-level supervisor to manage the teams.
from typing import Literal
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, MessagesState, START, END
from langgraph.types import Command
model = ChatOpenAI()

# define team 1 (same as the single supervisor example above)

def team_1_supervisor(state: MessagesState) -> Command[Literal["team_1_agent_1", "team_1_agent_2", END]]:
    response = model.invoke(...)
    return Command(goto=response["next_agent"])

def team_1_agent_1(state: MessagesState) -> Command[Literal["team_1_supervisor"]]:
    response = model.invoke(...)
    return Command(goto="team_1_supervisor", update={"messages": [response]})

def team_1_agent_2(state: MessagesState) -> Command[Literal["team_1_supervisor"]]:
    response = model.invoke(...)
    return Command(goto="team_1_supervisor", update={"messages": [response]})

team_1_builder = StateGraph(Team1State)
team_1_builder.add_node(team_1_supervisor)
team_1_builder.add_node(team_1_agent_1)
team_1_builder.add_node(team_1_agent_2)
team_1_builder.add_edge(START, "team_1_supervisor")
team_1_graph = team_1_builder.compile()

# define team 2 (same as the single supervisor example above)
class Team2State(MessagesState):
    next: Literal["team_2_agent_1", "team_2_agent_2", "__end__"]

def team_2_supervisor(state: Team2State):
    ...

def team_2_agent_1(state: Team2State):
    ...

def team_2_agent_2(state: Team2State):
    ...

team_2_builder = StateGraph(Team2State)
...
team_2_graph = team_2_builder.compile()

# define top-level supervisor

builder = StateGraph(MessagesState)
def top_level_supervisor(state: MessagesState) -> Command[Literal["team_1_graph", "team_2_graph", END]]:
    # you can pass relevant parts of the state to the LLM (e.g., state["messages"])
    # to determine which team to call next. a common pattern is to call the model
    # with a structured output (e.g. force it to return an output with a "next_team" field)
    response = model.invoke(...)
    # route to one of the teams or exit based on the supervisor's decision
    # if the supervisor returns "__end__", the graph will finish execution
    return Command(goto=response["next_team"])

builder = StateGraph(MessagesState)
builder.add_node(top_level_supervisor)
builder.add_node("team_1_graph", team_1_graph)
builder.add_node("team_2_graph", team_2_graph)
builder.add_edge(START, "top_level_supervisor")
builder.add_edge("team_1_graph", "top_level_supervisor")
builder.add_edge("team_2_graph", "top_level_supervisor")
graph = builder.compile()

API Reference: ChatOpenAI | StateGraph | START | END | Command
Custom multi-agent workflow¶
In this architecture we add individual agents as graph nodes and define the order in which agents are called ahead of time, in a custom workflow. In LangGraph the workflow can be defined in two ways:

Explicit control flow (normal edges): LangGraph allows you to explicitly define the control flow of your application (i.e. the sequence of how agents communicate) explicitly, via normal graph edges. This is the most deterministic variant of this architecture above — we always know which agent will be called next ahead of time.

Dynamic control flow (Command): in LangGraph you can allow LLMs to decide parts of your application control flow. This can be achieved by using Command. A special case of this is a supervisor tool-calling architecture. In that case, the tool-calling LLM powering the supervisor agent will make decisions about the order in which the tools (agents) are being called.

from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, MessagesState, START

model = ChatOpenAI()

def agent_1(state: MessagesState):
    response = model.invoke(...)
    return {"messages": [response]}

def agent_2(state: MessagesState):
    response = model.invoke(...)
    return {"messages": [response]}

builder = StateGraph(MessagesState)
builder.add_node(agent_1)
builder.add_node(agent_2)
# define the flow explicitly
builder.add_edge(START, "agent_1")
builder.add_edge("agent_1", "agent_2")

API Reference: ChatOpenAI | StateGraph | START
Communication between agents¶
The most important thing when building multi-agent systems is figuring out how the agents communicate. There are a few different considerations:

Do agents communicate via graph state or via tool calls?
What if two agents have different state schemas?
How to communicate over a shared message list?

Graph state vs tool calls¶
What is the "payload" that is being passed around between agents? In most of the architectures discussed above the agents communicate via the graph state. In the case of the supervisor with tool-calling, the payloads are tool call arguments.

Graph state¶
To communicate via graph state, individual agents need to be defined as graph nodes. These can be added as functions or as entire subgraphs. At each step of the graph execution, agent node receives the current state of the graph, executes the agent code and then passes the updated state to the next nodes.
Typically agent nodes share a single state schema. However, you might want to design agent nodes with different state schemas.
Different state schemas¶
An agent might need to have a different state schema from the rest of the agents. For example, a search agent might only need to keep track of queries and retrieved documents. There are two ways to achieve this in LangGraph:

Define subgraph agents with a separate state schema. If there are no shared state keys (channels) between the subgraph and the parent graph, it’s important to add input / output transformations so that the parent graph knows how to communicate with the subgraphs.
Define agent node functions with a private input state schema that is distinct from the overall graph state schema. This allows passing information that is only needed for executing that particular agent.

Shared message list¶
The most common way for the agents to communicate is via a shared state channel, typically a list of messages. This assumes that there is always at least a single channel (key) in the state that is shared by the agents. When communicating via a shared message list there is an additional consideration: should the agents share the full history of their thought process or only the final result?

Share full history¶
Agents can share the full history of their thought process (i.e. "scratchpad") with all other agents. This "scratchpad" would typically look like a list of messages. The benefit of sharing full thought process is that it might help other agents make better decisions and improve reasoning ability for the system as a whole. The downside is that as the number of agents and their complexity grows, the "scratchpad" will grow quickly and might require additional strategies for memory management.
Share final result¶
Agents can have their own private "scratchpad" and only share the final result with the rest of the agents. This approach might work better for systems with many agents or agents that are more complex. In this case, you would need to define agents with different state schemas
For agents called as tools, the supervisor determines the inputs based on the tool schema. Additionally, LangGraph allows passing state to individual tools at runtime, so subordinate agents can access parent state, if needed.

Memory¶
What is Memory?¶
Memory is a cognitive function that allows people to store, retrieve, and use information to understand their present and future. Consider the frustration of working with a colleague who forgets everything you tell them, requiring constant repetition! As AI agents undertake more complex tasks involving numerous user interactions, equipping them with memory becomes equally crucial for efficiency and user satisfaction. With memory, agents can learn from feedback and adapt to users' preferences. This guide covers two types of memory based on recall scope:
Short-term memory, or thread-scoped memory, can be recalled at any time from within a single conversational thread with a user. LangGraph manages short-term memory as a part of your agent's state. State is persisted to a database using a checkpointer so the thread can be resumed at any time. Short-term memory updates when the graph is invoked or a step is completed, and the State is read at the start of each step.
Long-term memory is shared across conversational threads. It can be recalled at any time and in any thread. Memories are scoped to any custom namespace, not just within a single thread ID. LangGraph provides stores (reference doc) to let you save and recall long-term memories.
Both are important to understand and implement for your application.

Short-term memory¶
Short-term memory lets your application remember previous interactions within a single thread or conversation. A thread organizes multiple interactions in a session, similar to the way email groups messages in a single conversation.
LangGraph manages short-term memory as part of the agent's state, persisted via thread-scoped checkpoints. This state can normally include the conversation history along with other stateful data, such as uploaded files, retrieved documents, or generated artifacts. By storing these in the graph's state, the bot can access the full context for a given conversation while maintaining separation between different threads.
Since conversation history is the most common form of representing short-term memory, in the next section, we will cover techniques for managing conversation history when the list of messages becomes long. If you want to stick to the high-level concepts, continue on to the long-term memory section.
Managing long conversation history¶
Long conversations pose a challenge to today's LLMs. The full history may not even fit inside an LLM's context window, resulting in an irrecoverable error. Even if your LLM technically supports the full context length, most LLMs still perform poorly over long contexts. They get "distracted" by stale or off-topic content, all while suffering from slower response times and higher costs.
Managing short-term memory is an exercise of balancing precision & recall with your application's other performance requirements (latency & cost). As always, it's important to think critically about how you represent information for your LLM and to look at your data. We cover a few common techniques for managing message lists below and hope to provide sufficient context for you to pick the best tradeoffs for your application:

Editing message lists: How to think about trimming and filtering a list of messages before passing to language model.
Summarizing past conversations: A common technique to use when you don't just want to filter the list of messages.

Editing message lists¶
Chat models accept context using messages, which include developer provided instructions (a system message) and user inputs (human messages). In chat applications, messages alternate between human inputs and model responses, resulting in a list of messages that grows longer over time. Because context windows are limited and token-rich message lists can be costly, many applications can benefit from using techniques to manually remove or forget stale information.

The most direct approach is to remove old messages from a list (similar to a least-recently used cache).
The typical technique for deleting content from a list in LangGraph is to return an update from a node telling the system to delete some portion of the list. You get to define what this update looks like, but a common approach would be to let you return an object or dictionary specifying which values to retain.
def manage_list(existing: list, updates: Union[list, dict]):
    if isinstance(updates, list):
        # Normal case, add to the history
        return existing + updates
    elif isinstance(updates, dict) and updates["type"] == "keep":
        # You get to decide what this looks like.
        # For example, you could simplify and just accept a string "DELETE"
        # and clear the entire list.
        return existing[updates["from"]:updates["to"]]
    # etc. We define how to interpret updates

class State(TypedDict):
    my_list: Annotated[list, manage_list]

def my_node(state: State):
    return {
        # We return an update for the field "my_list" saying to
        # keep only values from index -5 to the end (deleting the rest)
        "my_list": {"type": "keep", "from": -5, "to": None}
    }

LangGraph will call the manage_list "reducer" function any time an update is returned under the key "my_list". Within that function, we define what types of updates to accept. Typically, messages will be added to the existing list (the conversation will grow); however, we've also added support to accept a dictionary that lets you "keep" certain parts of the state. This lets you programmatically drop old message context.
Another common approach is to let you return a list of "remove" objects that specify the IDs of all messages to delete. If you're using the LangChain messages and the add_messages reducer (or MessagesState, which uses the same underlying functionality) in LangGraph, you can do this using a RemoveMessage.
from langchain_core.messages import RemoveMessage, AIMessage
from langgraph.graph import add_messages
# ... other imports

class State(TypedDict):
    # add_messages will default to upserting messages by ID to the existing list
    # if a RemoveMessage is returned, it will delete the message in the list by ID
    messages: Annotated[list, add_messages]

def my_node_1(state: State):
    # Add an AI message to the `messages` list in the state
    return {"messages": [AIMessage(content="Hi")]}

def my_node_2(state: State):
    # Delete all but the last 2 messages from the `messages` list in the state
    delete_messages = [RemoveMessage(id=m.id) for m in state['messages'][:-2]]
    return {"messages": delete_messages}

API Reference: RemoveMessage | AIMessage | add_messages
In the example above, the add_messages reducer allows us to append new messages to the messages state key as shown in my_node_1. When it sees a RemoveMessage, it will delete the message with that ID from the list (and the RemoveMessage will then be discarded). For more information on LangChain-specific message handling, check out this how-to on using RemoveMessage .
See this how-to guide and module 2 from our LangChain Academy course for example usage.
Summarizing past conversations¶
The problem with trimming or removing messages, as shown above, is that we may lose information from culling of the message queue. Because of this, some applications benefit from a more sophisticated approach of summarizing the message history using a chat model.

Simple prompting and orchestration logic can be used to achieve this. As an example, in LangGraph we can extend the MessagesState to include a summary key.
from langgraph.graph import MessagesState
class State(MessagesState):
    summary: str

Then, we can generate a summary of the chat history, using any existing summary as context for the next summary. This summarize_conversation node can be called after some number of messages have accumulated in the messages state key.
def summarize_conversation(state: State):

    # First, we get any existing summary
    summary = state.get("summary", "")

    # Create our summarization prompt
    if summary:

        # A summary already exists
        summary_message = (
            f"This is a summary of the conversation to date: {summary}\n\n"
            "Extend the summary by taking into account the new messages above:"
        )

    else:
        summary_message = "Create a summary of the conversation above:"

    # Add prompt to our history
    messages = state["messages"] + [HumanMessage(content=summary_message)]
    response = model.invoke(messages)

    # Delete all but the 2 most recent messages
    delete_messages = [RemoveMessage(id=m.id) for m in state["messages"][:-2]]
    return {"summary": response.content, "messages": delete_messages}

See this how-to here and module 2 from our LangChain Academy course for example usage.
Knowing when to remove messages¶
Most LLMs have a maximum supported context window (denominated in tokens). A simple way to decide when to truncate messages is to count the tokens in the message history and truncate whenever it approaches that limit. Naive truncation is straightforward to implement on your own, though there are a few "gotchas". Some model APIs further restrict the sequence of message types (must start with human message, cannot have consecutive messages of the same type, etc.). If you're using LangChain, you can use the trim_messages utility and specify the number of tokens to keep from the list, as well as the strategy (e.g., keep the last max_tokens) to use for handling the boundary.
Below is an example.
from langchain_core.messages import trim_messages
trim_messages(
    messages,
    # Keep the last <= n_count tokens of the messages.
    strategy="last",
    # Remember to adjust based on your model
    # or else pass a custom token_encoder
    token_counter=ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4"),
    # Remember to adjust based on the desired conversation
    # length
    max_tokens=45,
    # Most chat models expect that chat history starts with either:
    # (1) a HumanMessage or
    # (2) a SystemMessage followed by a HumanMessage
    start_on="human",
    # Most chat models expect that chat history ends with either:
    # (1) a HumanMessage or
    # (2) a ToolMessage
    end_on=("human", "tool"),
    # Usually, we want to keep the SystemMessage
    # if it's present in the original history.
    # The SystemMessage has special instructions for the model.
    include_system=True,
)

API Reference: trim_messages
Long-term memory¶
Long-term memory in LangGraph allows systems to retain information across different conversations or sessions. Unlike short-term memory, which is thread-scoped, long-term memory is saved within custom "namespaces."
Storing memories¶
LangGraph stores long-term memories as JSON documents in a store (reference doc). Each memory is organized under a custom namespace (similar to a folder) and a distinct key (like a filename). Namespaces often include user or org IDs or other labels that makes it easier to organize information. This structure enables hierarchical organization of memories. Cross-namespace searching is then supported through content filters. See the example below for an example.
from langgraph.store.memory import InMemoryStore

def embed(texts: list[str]) -> list[list[float]]:
    # Replace with an actual embedding function or LangChain embeddings object
    return [[1.0, 2.0] * len(texts)]

# InMemoryStore saves data to an in-memory dictionary. Use a DB-backed store in production use.
store = InMemoryStore(index={"embed": embed, "dims": 2})
user_id = "my-user"
application_context = "chitchat"
namespace = (user_id, application_context)
store.put(
    namespace,
    "a-memory",
    {
        "rules": [
            "User likes short, direct language",
            "User only speaks English & python",
        ],
        "my-key": "my-value",
    },
)
# get the "memory" by ID
item = store.get(namespace, "a-memory")
# search for "memories" within this namespace, filtering on content equivalence, sorted by vector similarity
items = store.search(
    namespace, filter={"my-key": "my-value"}, query="language preferences"
)

Framework for thinking about long-term memory¶
Long-term memory is a complex challenge without a one-size-fits-all solution. However, the following questions provide a structure framework to help you navigate the different techniques:
What is the type of memory?
Humans use memories to remember facts, experiences, and rules. AI agents can use memory in the same ways. For example, AI agents can use memory to remember specific facts about a user to accomplish a task. We expand on several types of memories in the section below.
When do you want to update memories?
Memory can be updated as part of an agent's application logic (e.g. "on the hot path"). In this case, the agent typically decides to remember facts before responding to a user. Alternatively, memory can be updated as a background task (logic that runs in the background / asynchronously and generates memories). We explain the tradeoffs between these approaches in the section below.
Memory types¶
Different applications require various types of memory. Although the analogy isn't perfect, examining human memory types can be insightful. Some research (e.g., the CoALA paper) have even mapped these human memory types to those used in AI agents.

Memory Type
What is Stored
Human Example
Agent Example

Semantic
Facts
Things I learned in school
Facts about a user

Episodic
Experiences
Things I did
Past agent actions

Procedural
Instructions
Instincts or motor skills
Agent system prompt

Semantic Memory¶
Semantic memory, both in humans and AI agents, involves the retention of specific facts and concepts. In humans, it can include information learned in school and the understanding of concepts and their relationships. For AI agents, semantic memory is often used to personalize applications by remembering facts or concepts from past interactions. 

Note: Not to be confused with "semantic search" which is a technique for finding similar content using "meaning" (usually as embeddings). Semantic memory is a term from psychology, referring to storing facts and knowledge, while semantic search is a method for retrieving information based on meaning rather than exact matches.

Profile¶
Semantic memories can be managed in different ways. For example, memories can be a single, continuously updated "profile" of well-scoped and specific information about a user, organization, or other entity (including the agent itself). A profile is generally just a JSON document with various key-value pairs you've selected to represent your domain. 
When remembering a profile, you will want to make sure that you are updating the profile each time. As a result, you will want to pass in the previous profile and ask the model to generate a new profile (or some JSON patch to apply to the old profile). This can be become error-prone as the profile gets larger, and may benefit from splitting a profile into multiple documents or strict decoding when generating documents to ensure the memory schemas remains valid.

Collection¶
Alternatively, memories can be a collection of documents that are continuously updated and extended over time. Each individual memory can be more narrowly scoped and easier to generate, which means that you're less likely to lose information over time. It's easier for an LLM to generate new objects for new information than reconcile new information with an existing profile. As a result, a document collection tends to lead to higher recall downstream.
However, this shifts some complexity memory updating. The model must now delete or update existing items in the list, which can be tricky. In addition, some models may default to over-inserting and others may default to over-updating. See the Trustcall package for one way to manage this and consider evaluation (e.g., with a tool like LangSmith) to help you tune the behavior.
Working with document collections also shifts complexity to memory search over the list. The Store currently supports both semantic search and filtering by content.
Finally, using a collection of memories can make it challenging to provide comprehensive context to the model. While individual memories may follow a specific schema, this structure might not capture the full context or relationships between memories. As a result, when using these memories to generate responses, the model may lack important contextual information that would be more readily available in a unified profile approach.

Regardless of memory management approach, the central point is that the agent will use the semantic memories to ground its responses, which often leads to more personalized and relevant interactions.
Episodic Memory¶
Episodic memory, in both humans and AI agents, involves recalling past events or actions. The CoALA paper frames this well: facts can be written to semantic memory, whereas experiences can be written to episodic memory. For AI agents, episodic memory is often used to help an agent remember how to accomplish a task. 
In practice, episodic memories are often implemented through few-shot example prompting, where agents learn from past sequences to perform tasks correctly. Sometimes it's easier to "show" than "tell" and LLMs learn well from examples. Few-shot learning lets you "program" your LLM by updating the prompt with input-output examples to illustrate the intended behavior. While various best-practices can be used to generate few-shot examples, often the challenge lies in selecting the most relevant examples based on user input.
Note that the memory store is just one way to store data as few-shot examples. If you want to have more developer involvement, or tie few-shots more closely to your evaluation harness, you can also use a LangSmith Dataset to store your data. Then dynamic few-shot example selectors can be used out-of-the box to achieve this same goal. LangSmith will index the dataset for you and enable retrieval of few shot examples that are most relevant to the user input based upon keyword similarity (using a BM25-like algorithm for keyword based similarity). 
See this how-to video for example usage of dynamic few-shot example selection in LangSmith. Also, see this blog post showcasing few-shot prompting to improve tool calling performance and this blog post using few-shot example to align an LLMs to human preferences.
Procedural Memory¶
Procedural memory, in both humans and AI agents, involves remembering the rules used to perform tasks. In humans, procedural memory is like the internalized knowledge of how to perform tasks, such as riding a bike via basic motor skills and balance. Episodic memory, on the other hand, involves recalling specific experiences, such as the first time you successfully rode a bike without training wheels or a memorable bike ride through a scenic route. For AI agents, procedural memory is a combination of model weights, agent code, and agent's prompt that collectively determine the agent's functionality. 
In practice, it is fairly uncommon for agents to modify their model weights or rewrite their code. However, it is more common for agents to modify their own prompts. 
One effective approach to refining an agent's instructions is through "Reflection" or meta-prompting. This involves prompting the agent with its current instructions (e.g., the system prompt) along with recent conversations or explicit user feedback. The agent then refines its own instructions based on this input. This method is particularly useful for tasks where instructions are challenging to specify upfront, as it allows the agent to learn and adapt from its interactions.
For example, we built a Tweet generator using external feedback and prompt re-writing to produce high-quality paper summaries for Twitter. In this case, the specific summarization prompt was difficult to specify a priori, but it was fairly easy for a user to critique the generated Tweets and provide feedback on how to improve the summarization process. 
The below pseudo-code shows how you might implement this with the LangGraph memory store, using the store to save a prompt, the update_instructions node to get the current prompt (as well as feedback from the conversation with the user captured in state["messages"]), update the prompt, and save the new prompt back to the store. Then, the call_model get the updated prompt from the store and uses it to generate a response.
# Node that *uses* the instructions
def call_model(state: State, store: BaseStore):
    namespace = ("agent_instructions", )
    instructions = store.get(namespace, key="agent_a")[0]
    # Application logic
    prompt = prompt_template.format(instructions=instructions.value["instructions"])
    ...

# Node that updates instructions
def update_instructions(state: State, store: BaseStore):
    namespace = ("instructions",)
    current_instructions = store.search(namespace)[0]
    # Memory logic
    prompt = prompt_template.format(instructions=instructions.value["instructions"], conversation=state["messages"])
    output = llm.invoke(prompt)
    new_instructions = output['new_instructions']
    store.put(("agent_instructions",), "agent_a", {"instructions": new_instructions})
    ...

Writing memories¶
While humans often form long-term memories during sleep, AI agents need a different approach. When and how should agents create new memories? There are at least two primary methods for agents to write memories: "on the hot path" and "in the background".

Writing memories in the hot path¶
Creating memories during runtime offers both advantages and challenges. On the positive side, this approach allows for real-time updates, making new memories immediately available for use in subsequent interactions. It also enables transparency, as users can be notified when memories are created and stored.
However, this method also presents challenges. It may increase complexity if the agent requires a new tool to decide what to commit to memory. In addition, the process of reasoning about what to save to memory can impact agent latency. Finally, the agent must multitask between memory creation and its other responsibilities, potentially affecting the quantity and quality of memories created.
As an example, ChatGPT uses a save_memories tool to upsert memories as content strings, deciding whether and how to use this tool with each user message. See our memory-agent template as an reference implementation.
Writing memories in the background¶
Creating memories as a separate background task offers several advantages. It eliminates latency in the primary application, separates application logic from memory management, and allows for more focused task completion by the agent. This approach also provides flexibility in timing memory creation to avoid redundant work.
However, this method has its own challenges. Determining the frequency of memory writing becomes crucial, as infrequent updates may leave other threads without new context. Deciding when to trigger memory formation is also important. Common strategies include scheduling after a set time period (with rescheduling if new events occur), using a cron schedule, or allowing manual triggers by users or the application logic.
See our memory-service template as an reference implementation.

LangGraph Glossary¶
Graphs¶
At its core, LangGraph models agent workflows as graphs. You define the behavior of your agents using three key components:

State: A shared data structure that represents the current snapshot of your application. It can be any Python type, but is typically a TypedDict or Pydantic BaseModel.

Nodes: Python functions that encode the logic of your agents. They receive the current State as input, perform some computation or side-effect, and return an updated State.

Edges: Python functions that determine which Node to execute next based on the current State. They can be conditional branches or fixed transitions.

By composing Nodes and Edges, you can create complex, looping workflows that evolve the State over time. The real power, though, comes from how LangGraph manages that State. To emphasize: Nodes and Edges are nothing more than Python functions - they can contain an LLM or just good ol' Python code.
In short: nodes do the work. edges tell what to do next.
LangGraph's underlying graph algorithm uses message passing to define a general program. When a Node completes its operation, it sends messages along one or more edges to other node(s). These recipient nodes then execute their functions, pass the resulting messages to the next set of nodes, and the process continues. Inspired by Google's Pregel system, the program proceeds in discrete "super-steps."
A super-step can be considered a single iteration over the graph nodes. Nodes that run in parallel are part of the same super-step, while nodes that run sequentially belong to separate super-steps. At the start of graph execution, all nodes begin in an inactive state. A node becomes active when it receives a new message (state) on any of its incoming edges (or "channels"). The active node then runs its function and responds with updates. At the end of each super-step, nodes with no incoming messages vote to halt by marking themselves as inactive. The graph execution terminates when all nodes are inactive and no messages are in transit.
StateGraph¶
The StateGraph class is the main graph class to use. This is parameterized by a user defined State object.
Compiling your graph¶
To build your graph, you first define the state, you then add nodes and edges, and then you compile it. What exactly is compiling your graph and why is it needed?
Compiling is a pretty simple step. It provides a few basic checks on the structure of your graph (no orphaned nodes, etc). It is also where you can specify runtime args like checkpointers and breakpoints. You compile your graph by just calling the .compile method:
graph = graph_builder.compile(...)

You MUST compile your graph before you can use it.
State¶
The first thing you do when you define a graph is define the State of the graph. The State consists of the schema of the graph as well as reducer functions which specify how to apply updates to the state. The schema of the State will be the input schema to all Nodes and Edges in the graph, and can be either a TypedDict or a Pydantic model. All Nodes will emit updates to the State which are then applied using the specified reducer function.
Schema¶
The main documented way to specify the schema of a graph is by using TypedDict. However, we also support using a Pydantic BaseModel as your graph state to add default values and additional data validation.
By default, the graph will have the same input and output schemas. If you want to change this, you can also specify explicit input and output schemas directly. This is useful when you have a lot of keys, and some are explicitly for input and others for output. See the notebook here for how to use.
Multiple schemas¶
Typically, all graph nodes communicate with a single schema. This means that they will read and write to the same state channels. But, there are cases where we want more control over this:

Internal nodes can pass information that is not required in the graph's input / output.
We may also want to use different input / output schemas for the graph. The output might, for example, only contain a single relevant output key.

It is possible to have nodes write to private state channels inside the graph for internal node communication. We can simply define a private schema, PrivateState. See this notebook for more detail.
It is also possible to define explicit input and output schemas for a graph. In these cases, we define an "internal" schema that contains all keys relevant to graph operations. But, we also define input and output schemas that are sub-sets of the "internal" schema to constrain the input and output of the graph. See this notebook for more detail.
Let's look at an example:
class InputState(TypedDict):
    user_input: str

class OutputState(TypedDict):
    graph_output: str

class OverallState(TypedDict):
    foo: str
    user_input: str
    graph_output: str

class PrivateState(TypedDict):
    bar: str

def node_1(state: InputState) -> OverallState:
    # Write to OverallState
    return {"foo": state["user_input"] + " name"}

def node_2(state: OverallState) -> PrivateState:
    # Read from OverallState, write to PrivateState
    return {"bar": state["foo"] + " is"}

def node_3(state: PrivateState) -> OutputState:
    # Read from PrivateState, write to OutputState
    return {"graph_output": state["bar"] + " Lance"}

builder = StateGraph(OverallState,input=InputState,output=OutputState)
builder.add_node("node_1", node_1)
builder.add_node("node_2", node_2)
builder.add_node("node_3", node_3)
builder.add_edge(START, "node_1")
builder.add_edge("node_1", "node_2")
builder.add_edge("node_2", "node_3")
builder.add_edge("node_3", END)

graph = builder.compile()
graph.invoke({"user_input":"My"})
{'graph_output': 'My name is Lance'}

There are two subtle and important points to note here:

We pass state: InputState as the input schema to node_1. But, we write out to foo, a channel in OverallState. How can we write out to a state channel that is not included in the input schema? This is because a node can write to any state channel in the graph state. The graph state is the union of of the state channels defined at initialization, which includes OverallState and the filters InputState and OutputState.

We initialize the graph with StateGraph(OverallState,input=InputState,output=OutputState). So, how can we write to PrivateState in node_2? How does the graph gain access to this schema if it was not passed in the StateGraph initialization? We can do this because nodes can also declare additional state channels as long as the state schema definition exists. In this case, the PrivateState schema is defined, so we can add bar as a new state channel in the graph and write to it.

Reducers¶
Reducers are key to understanding how updates from nodes are applied to the State. Each key in the State has its own independent reducer function. If no reducer function is explicitly specified then it is assumed that all updates to that key should override it. There are a few different types of reducers, starting with the default type of reducer:
Default Reducer¶
These two examples show how to use the default reducer:
Example A:
from typing_extensions import TypedDict

class State(TypedDict):
    foo: int
    bar: list[str]

In this example, no reducer functions are specified for any key. Let's assume the input to the graph is {"foo": 1, "bar": ["hi"]}. Let's then assume the first Node returns {"foo": 2}. This is treated as an update to the state. Notice that the Node does not need to return the whole State schema - just an update. After applying this update, the State would then be {"foo": 2, "bar": ["hi"]}. If the second node returns {"bar": ["bye"]} then the State would then be {"foo": 2, "bar": ["bye"]}
Example B:
from typing import Annotated
from typing_extensions import TypedDict
from operator import add

class State(TypedDict):
    foo: int
    bar: Annotated[list[str], add]

In this example, we've used the Annotated type to specify a reducer function (operator.add) for the second key (bar). Note that the first key remains unchanged. Let's assume the input to the graph is {"foo": 1, "bar": ["hi"]}. Let's then assume the first Node returns {"foo": 2}. This is treated as an update to the state. Notice that the Node does not need to return the whole State schema - just an update. After applying this update, the State would then be {"foo": 2, "bar": ["hi"]}. If the second node returns {"bar": ["bye"]} then the State would then be {"foo": 2, "bar": ["hi", "bye"]}. Notice here that the bar key is updated by adding the two lists together.
Working with Messages in Graph State¶
Why use messages?¶
Most modern LLM providers have a chat model interface that accepts a list of messages as input. LangChain's ChatModel in particular accepts a list of Message objects as inputs. These messages come in a variety of forms such as HumanMessage (user input) or AIMessage (LLM response). To read more about what message objects are, please refer to this conceptual guide.
Using Messages in your Graph¶
In many cases, it is helpful to store prior conversation history as a list of messages in your graph state. To do so, we can add a key (channel) to the graph state that stores a list of Message objects and annotate it with a reducer function (see messages key in the example below). The reducer function is vital to telling the graph how to update the list of Message objects in the state with each state update (for example, when a node sends an update). If you don't specify a reducer, every state update will overwrite the list of messages with the most recently provided value. If you wanted to simply append messages to the existing list, you could use operator.add as a reducer.
However, you might also want to manually update messages in your graph state (e.g. human-in-the-loop). If you were to use operator.add, the manual state updates you send to the graph would be appended to the existing list of messages, instead of updating existing messages. To avoid that, you need a reducer that can keep track of message IDs and overwrite existing messages, if updated. To achieve this, you can use the prebuilt add_messages function. For brand new messages, it will simply append to existing list, but it will also handle the updates for existing messages correctly.
Serialization¶
In addition to keeping track of message IDs, the add_messages function will also try to deserialize messages into LangChain Message objects whenever a state update is received on the messages channel. See more information on LangChain serialization/deserialization here. This allows sending graph inputs / state updates in the following format:
# this is supported
{"messages": [HumanMessage(content="message")]}

# and this is also supported
{"messages": [{"type": "human", "content": "message"}]}

Since the state updates are always deserialized into LangChain Messages when using add_messages, you should use dot notation to access message attributes, like state["messages"][-1].content. Below is an example of a graph that uses add_messages as it's reducer function.
from langchain_core.messages import AnyMessage
from langgraph.graph.message import add_messages
from typing import Annotated
from typing_extensions import TypedDict

class GraphState(TypedDict):
    messages: Annotated[list[AnyMessage], add_messages]

API Reference: AnyMessage | add_messages
MessagesState¶
Since having a list of messages in your state is so common, there exists a prebuilt state called MessagesState which makes it easy to use messages. MessagesState is defined with a single messages key which is a list of AnyMessage objects and uses the add_messages reducer. Typically, there is more state to track than just messages, so we see people subclass this state and add more fields, like:
from langgraph.graph import MessagesState

class State(MessagesState):
    documents: list[str]

Nodes¶
In LangGraph, nodes are typically python functions (sync or async) where the first positional argument is the state, and (optionally), the second positional argument is a "config", containing optional configurable parameters (such as a thread_id).
Similar to NetworkX, you add these nodes to a graph using the add_node method:
from langchain_core.runnables import RunnableConfig
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph

builder = StateGraph(dict)

def my_node(state: dict, config: RunnableConfig):
    print("In node: ", config["configurable"]["user_id"])
    return {"results": f"Hello, {state['input']}!"}

# The second argument is optional
def my_other_node(state: dict):
    return state

builder.add_node("my_node", my_node)
builder.add_node("other_node", my_other_node)
...

API Reference: RunnableConfig | StateGraph
Behind the scenes, functions are converted to RunnableLambdas, which add batch and async support to your function, along with native tracing and debugging.
If you add a node to a graph without specifying a name, it will be given a default name equivalent to the function name.
builder.add_node(my_node)
# You can then create edges to/from this node by referencing it as `"my_node"`

START Node¶
The START Node is a special node that represents the node that sends user input to the graph. The main purpose for referencing this node is to determine which nodes should be called first.
from langgraph.graph import START

graph.add_edge(START, "node_a")

API Reference: START
END Node¶
The END Node is a special node that represents a terminal node. This node is referenced when you want to denote which edges have no actions after they are done.
from langgraph.graph import END

graph.add_edge("node_a", END)

Edges¶
Edges define how the logic is routed and how the graph decides to stop. This is a big part of how your agents work and how different nodes communicate with each other. There are a few key types of edges:

Normal Edges: Go directly from one node to the next.
Conditional Edges: Call a function to determine which node(s) to go to next.
Entry Point: Which node to call first when user input arrives.
Conditional Entry Point: Call a function to determine which node(s) to call first when user input arrives.

A node can have MULTIPLE outgoing edges. If a node has multiple out-going edges, all of those destination nodes will be executed in parallel as a part of the next superstep.
Normal Edges¶
If you always want to go from node A to node B, you can use the add_edge method directly.
graph.add_edge("node_a", "node_b")

Conditional Edges¶
If you want to optionally route to 1 or more edges (or optionally terminate), you can use the add_conditional_edges method. This method accepts the name of a node and a "routing function" to call after that node is executed:
graph.add_conditional_edges("node_a", routing_function)

Similar to nodes, the routing_function accepts the current state of the graph and returns a value.
By default, the return value routing_function is used as the name of the node (or list of nodes) to send the state to next. All those nodes will be run in parallel as a part of the next superstep.
You can optionally provide a dictionary that maps the routing_function's output to the name of the next node.
graph.add_conditional_edges("node_a", routing_function, {True: "node_b", False: "node_c"})

Tip
Use Command instead of conditional edges if you want to combine state updates and routing in a single function.

Entry Point¶
The entry point is the first node(s) that are run when the graph starts. You can use the add_edge method from the virtual START node to the first node to execute to specify where to enter the graph.
from langgraph.graph import START

graph.add_edge(START, "node_a")

API Reference: START
Conditional Entry Point¶
A conditional entry point lets you start at different nodes depending on custom logic. You can use add_conditional_edges from the virtual START node to accomplish this.
from langgraph.graph import START

graph.add_conditional_edges(START, routing_function)

API Reference: START
You can optionally provide a dictionary that maps the routing_function's output to the name of the next node.
graph.add_conditional_edges(START, routing_function, {True: "node_b", False: "node_c"})

Send¶
By default, Nodes and Edges are defined ahead of time and operate on the same shared state. However, there can be cases where the exact edges are not known ahead of time and/or you may want different versions of State to exist at the same time. A common example of this is with map-reduce design patterns. In this design pattern, a first node may generate a list of objects, and you may want to apply some other node to all those objects. The number of objects may be unknown ahead of time (meaning the number of edges may not be known) and the input State to the downstream Node should be different (one for each generated object).
To support this design pattern, LangGraph supports returning Send objects from conditional edges. Send takes two arguments: first is the name of the node, and second is the state to pass to that node.
def continue_to_jokes(state: OverallState):
    return [Send("generate_joke", {"subject": s}) for s in state['subjects']]

graph.add_conditional_edges("node_a", continue_to_jokes)

Command¶
It can be useful to combine control flow (edges) and state updates (nodes). For example, you might want to BOTH perform state updates AND decide which node to go to next in the SAME node. LangGraph provides a way to do so by returning a Command object from node functions:
def my_node(state: State) -> Command[Literal["my_other_node"]]:
    return Command(
        # state update
        update={"foo": "bar"},
        # control flow
        goto="my_other_node"
    )

With Command you can also achieve dynamic control flow behavior (identical to conditional edges):
def my_node(state: State) -> Command[Literal["my_other_node"]]:
    if state["foo"] == "bar":
        return Command(update={"foo": "baz"}, goto="my_other_node")

Important
When returning Command in your node functions, you must add return type annotations with the list of node names the node is routing to, e.g. Command[Literal["my_other_node"]]. This is necessary for the graph rendering and tells LangGraph that my_node can navigate to my_other_node.

Check out this how-to guide for an end-to-end example of how to use Command.
When should I use Command instead of conditional edges?¶
Use Command when you need to both update the graph state and route to a different node. For example, when implementing multi-agent handoffs where it's important to route to a different agent and pass some information to that agent.
Use conditional edges to route between nodes conditionally without updating the state.
Navigating to a node in a parent graph¶
If you are using subgraphs, you might want to navigate from a node within a subgraph to a different subgraph (i.e. a different node in the parent graph). To do so, you can specify graph=Command.PARENT in Command:
def my_node(state: State) -> Command[Literal["other_subgraph"]]:
    return Command(
        update={"foo": "bar"},
        goto="other_subgraph",  # where `other_subgraph` is a node in the parent graph
        graph=Command.PARENT
    )

Note
Setting graph to Command.PARENT will navigate to the closest parent graph.

State updates with Command.PARENT
When you send updates from a subgraph node to a parent graph node for a key that's shared by both parent and subgraph state schemas, you must define a reducer for the key you're updating in the parent graph state. See this example.

This is particularly useful when implementing multi-agent handoffs.
Using inside tools¶
A common use case is updating graph state from inside a tool. For example, in a customer support application you might want to look up customer information based on their account number or ID in the beginning of the conversation. To update the graph state from the tool, you can return Command(update={"my_custom_key": "foo", "messages": [...]}) from the tool:
@tool
def lookup_user_info(tool_call_id: Annotated[str, InjectedToolCallId], config: RunnableConfig):
    """Use this to look up user information to better assist them with their questions."""
    user_info = get_user_info(config.get("configurable", {}).get("user_id"))
    return Command(
        update={
            # update the state keys
            "user_info": user_info,
            # update the message history
            "messages": [ToolMessage("Successfully looked up user information", tool_call_id=tool_call_id)]
        }
    )

Important
You MUST include messages (or any state key used for the message history) in Command.update when returning Command from a tool and the list of messages in messages MUST contain a ToolMessage. This is necessary for the resulting message history to be valid (LLM providers require AI messages with tool calls to be followed by the tool result messages).

If you are using tools that update state via Command, we recommend using prebuilt ToolNode which automatically handles tools returning Command objects and propagates them to the graph state. If you're writing a custom node that calls tools, you would need to manually propagate Command objects returned by the tools as the update from the node.
Human-in-the-loop¶
Command is an important part of human-in-the-loop workflows: when using interrupt() to collect user input, Command is then used to supply the input and resume execution via Command(resume="User input"). Check out this conceptual guide for more information.
Persistence¶
LangGraph provides built-in persistence for your agent's state using checkpointers. Checkpointers save snapshots of the graph state at every superstep, allowing resumption at any time. This enables features like human-in-the-loop interactions, memory management, and fault-tolerance. You can even directly manipulate a graph's state after its execution using the
appropriate get and update methods. For more details, see the persistence conceptual guide.
Threads¶
Threads in LangGraph represent individual sessions or conversations between your graph and a user. When using checkpointing, turns in a single conversation (and even steps within a single graph execution) are organized by a unique thread ID.
Storage¶
LangGraph provides built-in document storage through the BaseStore interface. Unlike checkpointers, which save state by thread ID, stores use custom namespaces for organizing data. This enables cross-thread persistence, allowing agents to maintain long-term memories, learn from past interactions, and accumulate knowledge over time. Common use cases include storing user profiles, building knowledge bases, and managing global preferences across all threads.
Graph Migrations¶
LangGraph can easily handle migrations of graph definitions (nodes, edges, and state) even when using a checkpointer to track state.

For threads at the end of the graph (i.e. not interrupted) you can change the entire topology of the graph (i.e. all nodes and edges, remove, add, rename, etc)
For threads currently interrupted, we support all topology changes other than renaming / removing nodes (as that thread could now be about to enter a node that no longer exists) -- if this is a blocker please reach out and we can prioritize a solution.
For modifying state, we have full backwards and forwards compatibility for adding and removing keys
State keys that are renamed lose their saved state in existing threads
State keys whose types change in incompatible ways could currently cause issues in threads with state from before the change -- if this is a blocker please reach out and we can prioritize a solution.

Configuration¶
When creating a graph, you can also mark that certain parts of the graph are configurable. This is commonly done to enable easily switching between models or system prompts. This allows you to create a single "cognitive architecture" (the graph) but have multiple different instance of it.
You can optionally specify a config_schema when creating a graph.
class ConfigSchema(TypedDict):
    llm: str

graph = StateGraph(State, config_schema=ConfigSchema)

You can then pass this configuration into the graph using the configurable config field.
config = {"configurable": {"llm": "anthropic"}}

graph.invoke(inputs, config=config)

You can then access and use this configuration inside a node:
def node_a(state, config):
    llm_type = config.get("configurable", {}).get("llm", "openai")
    llm = get_llm(llm_type)
    ...

See this guide for a full breakdown on configuration.
Recursion Limit¶
The recursion limit sets the maximum number of super-steps the graph can execute during a single execution. Once the limit is reached, LangGraph will raise GraphRecursionError. By default this value is set to 25 steps. The recursion limit can be set on any graph at runtime, and is passed to .invoke/.stream via the config dictionary. Importantly, recursion_limit is a standalone config key and should not be passed inside the configurable key as all other user-defined configuration. See the example below:
graph.invoke(inputs, config={"recursion_limit": 5, "configurable":{"llm": "anthropic"}})

Read this how-to to learn more about how the recursion limit works.
interrupt¶
Use the interrupt function to pause the graph at specific points to collect user input. The interrupt function surfaces interrupt information to the client, allowing the developer to collect user input, validate the graph state, or make decisions before resuming execution.
from langgraph.types import interrupt

def human_approval_node(state: State):
    ...
    answer = interrupt(
        # This value will be sent to the client.
        # It can be any JSON serializable value.
        {"question": "is it ok to continue?"},
    )
    ...

API Reference: interrupt
Resuming the graph is done by passing a Command object to the graph with the resume key set to the value returned by the interrupt function.
Read more about how the interrupt is used for human-in-the-loop workflows in the Human-in-the-loop conceptual guide.
Breakpoints¶
Breakpoints pause graph execution at specific points and enable stepping through execution step by step. Breakpoints are powered by LangGraph's persistence layer, which saves the state after each graph step. Breakpoints can also be used to enable human-in-the-loop workflows, though we recommend using the interrupt function for this purpose.
Read more about breakpoints in the Breakpoints conceptual guide.
Subgraphs¶
A subgraph is a graph that is used as a node in another graph. This is nothing more than the age-old concept of encapsulation, applied to LangGraph. Some reasons for using subgraphs are:

building multi-agent systems

when you want to reuse a set of nodes in multiple graphs, which maybe share some state, you can define them once in a subgraph and then use them in multiple parent graphs

when you want different teams to work on different parts of the graph independently, you can define each part as a subgraph, and as long as the subgraph interface (the input and output schemas) is respected, the parent graph can be built without knowing any details of the subgraph

There are two ways to add subgraphs to a parent graph:

add a node with the compiled subgraph: this is useful when the parent graph and the subgraph share state keys and you don't need to transform state on the way in or out

builder.add_node("subgraph", subgraph_builder.compile())

add a node with a function that invokes the subgraph: this is useful when the parent graph and the subgraph have different state schemas and you need to transform state before or after calling the subgraph

subgraph = subgraph_builder.compile()

def call_subgraph(state: State):
    return subgraph.invoke({"subgraph_key": state["parent_key"]})

builder.add_node("subgraph", call_subgraph)

Let's take a look at examples for each.
As a compiled graph¶
The simplest way to create subgraph nodes is by using a compiled subgraph directly. When doing so, it is important that the parent graph and the subgraph state schemas share at least one key which they can use to communicate. If your graph and subgraph do not share any keys, you should write a function invoking the subgraph instead.

Note
If you pass extra keys to the subgraph node (i.e., in addition to the shared keys), they will be ignored by the subgraph node. Similarly, if you return extra keys from the subgraph, they will be ignored by the parent graph.

from langgraph.graph import StateGraph
from typing import TypedDict

class State(TypedDict):
    foo: str

class SubgraphState(TypedDict):
    foo: str  # note that this key is shared with the parent graph state
    bar: str

# Define subgraph
def subgraph_node(state: SubgraphState):
    # note that this subgraph node can communicate with the parent graph via the shared "foo" key
    return {"foo": state["foo"] + "bar"}

subgraph_builder = StateGraph(SubgraphState)
subgraph_builder.add_node(subgraph_node)
...
subgraph = subgraph_builder.compile()

# Define parent graph
builder = StateGraph(State)
builder.add_node("subgraph", subgraph)
...
graph = builder.compile()

API Reference: StateGraph
As a function¶
You might want to define a subgraph with a completely different schema. In this case, you can create a node function that invokes the subgraph. This function will need to transform the input (parent) state to the subgraph state before invoking the subgraph, and transform the results back to the parent state before returning the state update from the node.
class State(TypedDict):
    foo: str

class SubgraphState(TypedDict):
    # note that none of these keys are shared with the parent graph state
    bar: str
    baz: str

# Define subgraph
def subgraph_node(state: SubgraphState):
    return {"bar": state["bar"] + "baz"}

subgraph_builder = StateGraph(SubgraphState)
subgraph_builder.add_node(subgraph_node)
...
subgraph = subgraph_builder.compile()

# Define parent graph
def node(state: State):
    # transform the state to the subgraph state
    response = subgraph.invoke({"bar": state["foo"]})
    # transform response back to the parent state
    return {"foo": response["bar"]}

builder = StateGraph(State)
# note that we are using `node` function instead of a compiled subgraph
builder.add_node(node)
...
graph = builder.compile()

Visualization¶
It's often nice to be able to visualize graphs, especially as they get more complex. LangGraph comes with several built-in ways to visualize graphs. See this how-to guide for more info.
Streaming¶
LangGraph is built with first class support for streaming, including streaming updates from graph nodes during the execution, streaming tokens from LLM calls and more. See this conceptual guide for more information.

DOCUMENT 35
SOURCE: https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/durable_execution/
CONTENT:
Durable Execution¶
Durable execution is a technique in which a process or workflow saves its progress at key points, allowing it to pause and later resume exactly where it left off. This is particularly useful in scenarios that require human-in-the-loop, where users can inspect, validate, or modify the process before continuing, and in long-running tasks that might encounter interruptions or errors (e.g., calls to an LLM timing out). By preserving completed work, durable execution enables a process to resume without reprocessing previous steps -- even after a significant delay (e.g., a week later). 
LangGraph's built-in persistence layer provides durable execution for workflows, ensuring that the state of each execution step is saved to a durable store. This capability guarantees that if a workflow is interrupted -- whether by a system failure or for human-in-the-loop interactions -- it can be resumed from its last recorded state.

Tip
If you are using LangGraph with a checkpointer, you already have durable execution enabled. You can pause and resume workflows at any point, even after interruptions or failures.
To make the most of durable execution, ensure that your workflow is designed to be deterministic and idempotent and wrap any side effects or non-deterministic operations inside tasks. You can use tasks from both the StateGraph (Graph API) and the Functional API.

Requirements¶
To leverage durable execution in LangGraph, you need to:

Enable persistence in your workflow by specifying a checkpointer that will save workflow progress.
Specify a thread identifier when executing a workflow. This will track the execution history for a particular instance of the workflow.
Wrap any non-deterministic operations (e.g., random number generation) or operations with side effects (e.g., file writes, API calls) inside tasks to ensure that when a workflow is resumed, these operations are not repeated for the particular run, and instead their results are retrieved from the persistence layer. For more information, see Determinism and Consistent Replay.

Determinism and Consistent Replay¶
When you resume a workflow run, the code does NOT resume from the same line of code where execution stopped; instead, it will identify an appropriate starting point from which to pick up where it left off. This means that the workflow will replay all steps from the starting point until it reaches the point where it was stopped.
As a result, when you are writing a workflow for durable execution, you must wrap any non-deterministic operations (e.g., random number generation) and any operations with side effects (e.g., file writes, API calls) inside tasks or nodes.
To ensure that your workflow is deterministic and can be consistently replayed, follow these guidelines:

Avoid Repeating Work:  If a node contains multiple operations with side effects (e.g., logging, file writes, or network calls), wrap each operation in a separate task. This ensures that when the workflow is resumed, the operations are not repeated, and their results are retrieved from the persistence layer.
Encapsulate Non-Deterministic Operations:  Wrap any code that might yield non-deterministic results (e.g., random number generation) inside tasks or nodes. This ensures that, upon resumption, the workflow follows the exact recorded sequence of steps with the same outcomes.
Use Idempotent Operations: When possible ensure that side effects (e.g., API calls, file writes) are idempotent. This means that if an operation is retried after a failure in the workflow, it will have the same effect as the first time it was executed. This is particularly important for operations that result in data writes. In the event that a task starts but fails to complete successfully, the workflow's resumption will re-run the task, relying on recorded outcomes to maintain consistency. Use idempotency keys or verify existing results to avoid unintended duplication, ensuring a smooth and predictable workflow execution.

For some examples of pitfalls to avoid, see the Common Pitfalls section in the functional API, which shows
how to structure your code using tasks to avoid these issues. The same principles apply to the StateGraph (Graph API).
Using tasks in nodes¶
If a node contains multiple operations, you may find it easier to convert each operation into a task rather than refactor the operations into individual nodes.

config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": thread_id}}

# Invoke the graph
graph.invoke({"urls": ["https://www.example.com"]}, config)

Resuming Workflows¶
Once you have enabled durable execution in your workflow, you can resume execution for the following scenarios:

Pausing and Resuming Workflows: Use the interrupt function to pause a workflow at specific points and the Command primitive to resume it with updated state. See Human-in-the-Loop for more details.
Recovering from Failures: Automatically resume workflows from the last successful checkpoint after an exception (e.g., LLM provider outage). This involves executing the workflow with the same thread identifier by providing it with a None as the input value (see this example with the functional API).

Starting Points for Resuming Workflows¶

If you're using a StateGraph (Graph API), the starting point is the beginning of the node where execution stopped. 
If you're making a subgraph call inside a node, the starting point will be the parent node that called the subgraph that was halted.
Inside the subgraph, the starting point will be the specific node where execution stopped.
If you're using the Functional API, the starting point is the beginning of the entrypoint where execution stopped.

Agent architectures¶
Many LLM applications implement a particular control flow of steps before and / or after LLM calls. As an example, RAG performs retrieval of documents relevant to a user question, and passes those documents to an LLM in order to ground the model's response in the provided document context. 
Instead of hard-coding a fixed control flow, we sometimes want LLM systems that can pick their own control flow to solve more complex problems! This is one definition of an agent: an agent is a system that uses an LLM to decide the control flow of an application. There are many ways that an LLM can control application:

An LLM can route between two potential paths
An LLM can decide which of many tools to call
An LLM can decide whether the generated answer is sufficient or more work is needed

As a result, there are many different types of agent architectures, which give an LLM varying levels of control. 

Router¶
A router allows an LLM to select a single step from a specified set of options. This is an agent architecture that exhibits a relatively limited level of control because the LLM usually focuses on making a single decision and produces a specific output from a limited set of pre-defined options. Routers typically employ a few different concepts to achieve this.
Structured Output¶
Structured outputs with LLMs work by providing a specific format or schema that the LLM should follow in its response. This is similar to tool calling, but more general. While tool calling typically involves selecting and using predefined functions, structured outputs can be used for any type of formatted response. Common methods to achieve structured outputs include:

Prompt engineering: Instructing the LLM to respond in a specific format via the system prompt.
Output parsers: Using post-processing to extract structured data from LLM responses.
Tool calling: Leveraging built-in tool calling capabilities of some LLMs to generate structured outputs.

Structured outputs are crucial for routing as they ensure the LLM's decision can be reliably interpreted and acted upon by the system. Learn more about structured outputs in this how-to guide.
Tool calling agent¶
While a router allows an LLM to make a single decision, more complex agent architectures expand the LLM's control in two key ways:

Multi-step decision making: The LLM can make a series of decisions, one after another, instead of just one.
Tool access: The LLM can choose from and use a variety of tools to accomplish tasks.

ReAct is a popular general purpose agent architecture that combines these expansions, integrating three core concepts. 

Tool calling: Allowing the LLM to select and use various tools as needed.
Memory: Enabling the agent to retain and use information from previous steps.
Planning: Empowering the LLM to create and follow multi-step plans to achieve goals.

This architecture allows for more complex and flexible agent behaviors, going beyond simple routing to enable dynamic problem-solving with multiple steps. You can use it with create_react_agent.
Tool calling¶
Tools are useful whenever you want an agent to interact with external systems. External systems (e.g., APIs) often require a particular input schema or payload, rather than natural language. When we bind an API, for example, as a tool, we give the model awareness of the required input schema. The model will choose to call a tool based upon the natural language input from the user and it will return an output that adheres to the tool's required schema. 
Many LLM providers support tool calling and tool calling interface in LangChain is simple: you can simply pass any Python function into ChatModel.bind_tools(function).

Memory¶
Memory is crucial for agents, enabling them to retain and utilize information across multiple steps of problem-solving. It operates on different scales:

Short-term memory: Allows the agent to access information acquired during earlier steps in a sequence.
Long-term memory: Enables the agent to recall information from previous interactions, such as past messages in a conversation.

LangGraph provides full control over memory implementation:

State: User-defined schema specifying the exact structure of memory to retain.
Checkpointers: Mechanism to store state at every step across different interactions.

This flexible approach allows you to tailor the memory system to your specific agent architecture needs. For a practical guide on adding memory to your graph, see this tutorial.
Effective memory management enhances an agent's ability to maintain context, learn from past experiences, and make more informed decisions over time.
Planning¶
In the ReAct architecture, an LLM is called repeatedly in a while-loop. At each step the agent decides which tools to call, and what the inputs to those tools should be. Those tools are then executed, and the outputs are fed back into the LLM as observations. The while-loop terminates when the agent decides it has enough information to solve the user request and it is not worth calling any more tools.
ReAct implementation¶
There are several differences between this paper and the pre-built create_react_agent implementation:

First, we use tool-calling to have LLMs call tools, whereas the paper used prompting + parsing of raw output. This is because tool calling did not exist when the paper was written, but is generally better and more reliable.
Second, we use messages to prompt the LLM, whereas the paper used string formatting. This is because at the time of writing, LLMs didn't even expose a message-based interface, whereas now that's the only interface they expose.
Third, the paper required all inputs to the tools to be a single string. This was largely due to LLMs not being super capable at the time, and only really being able to generate a single input. Our implementation allows for using tools that require multiple inputs.
Fourth, the paper only looks at calling a single tool at the time, largely due to limitations in LLMs performance at the time. Our implementation allows for calling multiple tools at a time.
Finally, the paper asked the LLM to explicitly generate a "Thought" step before deciding which tools to call. This is the "Reasoning" part of "ReAct". Our implementation does not do this by default, largely because LLMs have gotten much better and that is not as necessary. Of course, if you wish to prompt it do so, you certainly can.

Custom agent architectures¶
While routers and tool-calling agents (like ReAct) are common, customizing agent architectures often leads to better performance for specific tasks. LangGraph offers several powerful features for building tailored agent systems:
Human-in-the-loop¶
Human involvement can significantly enhance agent reliability, especially for sensitive tasks. This can involve:

Approving specific actions
Providing feedback to update the agent's state
Offering guidance in complex decision-making processes

Human-in-the-loop patterns are crucial when full automation isn't feasible or desirable. Learn more in our human-in-the-loop guide.
Parallelization¶
Parallel processing is vital for efficient multi-agent systems and complex tasks. LangGraph supports parallelization through its Send API, enabling:

Concurrent processing of multiple states
Implementation of map-reduce-like operations
Efficient handling of independent subtasks

For practical implementation, see our map-reduce tutorial.
Subgraphs¶
Subgraphs are essential for managing complex agent architectures, particularly in multi-agent systems. They allow:

Isolated state management for individual agents
Hierarchical organization of agent teams
Controlled communication between agents and the main system

Subgraphs communicate with the parent graph through overlapping keys in the state schema. This enables flexible, modular agent design. For implementation details, refer to our subgraph how-to guide.
Reflection¶
Reflection mechanisms can significantly improve agent reliability by:

Evaluating task completion and correctness
Providing feedback for iterative improvement
Enabling self-correction and learning

While often LLM-based, reflection can also use deterministic methods. For instance, in coding tasks, compilation errors can serve as feedback. This approach is demonstrated in this video using LangGraph for self-corrective code generation.
By leveraging these features, LangGraph enables the creation of sophisticated, task-specific agent architectures that can handle complex workflows, collaborate effectively, and continuously improve their performance.

Why LangGraph?¶
LLM applications¶
LLMs make it possible to embed intelligence into a new class of applications. There are many patterns for building applications that use LLMs. Workflows have scaffolding of predefined code paths around LLM calls. LLMs can direct the control flow through these predefined code paths, which some consider to be an "agentic system". In other cases, it's possible to remove this scaffolding, creating autonomous agents that can plan, take actions via tool calls, and directly respond to the feedback from their own actions with further actions.

What LangGraph provides¶
LangGraph provides low-level supporting infrastructure that sits underneath any workflow or agent. It does not abstract prompts or architecture, and provides three central benefits:
Persistence¶
LangGraph has a persistence layer, which offers a number of benefits:

Memory: LangGraph persists arbitrary aspects of your application's state, supporting memory of conversations and other updates within and across user interactions;
Human-in-the-loop: Because state is checkpointed, execution can be interrupted and resumed, allowing for decisions, validation, and corrections via human input.

Streaming¶
LangGraph also provides support for streaming workflow / agent state to the user (or developer) over the course of execution. LangGraph supports streaming of both events (such as feedback from a tool call) and tokens from LLM calls embedded in an application.
Debugging and Deployment¶
LangGraph provides an easy onramp for testing, debugging, and deploying applications via LangGraph Platform. This includes Studio, an IDE that enables visualization, interaction, and debugging of workflows or agents. This also includes numerous options for deployment.

Human-in-the-loop¶

Use the interrupt function instead.
As of LangGraph 0.2.57, the recommended way to set breakpoints is using the interrupt function as it simplifies human-in-the-loop patterns.
Please see the revised human-in-the-loop guide for the latest version that uses the interrupt function.

Human-in-the-loop (or "on-the-loop") enhances agent capabilities through several common user interaction patterns.
Common interaction patterns include:
(1) Approval - We can interrupt our agent, surface the current state to a user, and allow the user to accept an action. 
(2) Editing - We can interrupt our agent, surface the current state to a user, and allow the user to edit the agent state. 
(3) Input - We can explicitly create a graph node to collect human input and pass that input directly to the agent state.
Use-cases for these interaction patterns include:
(1) Reviewing tool calls - We can interrupt an agent to review and edit the results of tool calls.
(2) Time Travel - We can manually re-play and / or fork past actions of an agent.
Persistence¶
All of these interaction patterns are enabled by LangGraph's built-in persistence layer, which will write a checkpoint of the graph state at each step. Persistence allows the graph to stop so that a human can review and / or edit the current state of the graph and then resume with the human's input.
Breakpoints¶
Adding a breakpoint a specific location in the graph flow is one way to enable human-in-the-loop. In this case, the developer knows where in the workflow human input is needed and simply places a breakpoint prior to or following that particular graph node.
Here, we compile our graph with a checkpointer and a breakpoint at the node we want to interrupt before, step_for_human_in_the_loop. We then perform one of the above interaction patterns, which will create a new checkpoint if a human edits the graph state. The new checkpoint is saved to the thread and we can resume the graph execution from there by passing in None as the input.
# Compile our graph with a checkpointer and a breakpoint before "step_for_human_in_the_loop"
graph = builder.compile(checkpointer=checkpointer, interrupt_before=["step_for_human_in_the_loop"])

# Run the graph up to the breakpoint
thread_config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "1"}}
for event in graph.stream(inputs, thread_config, stream_mode="values"):
    print(event)

# Perform some action that requires human in the loop

# Continue the graph execution from the current checkpoint 
for event in graph.stream(None, thread_config, stream_mode="values"):
    print(event)

Dynamic Breakpoints¶
Alternatively, the developer can define some condition that must be met for a breakpoint to be triggered. This concept of dynamic breakpoints is useful when the developer wants to halt the graph under a particular condition. This uses a NodeInterrupt, which is a special type of exception that can be raised from within a node based upon some condition. As an example, we can define a dynamic breakpoint that triggers when the input is longer than 5 characters.
def my_node(state: State) -> State:
    if len(state['input']) > 5:
        raise NodeInterrupt(f"Received input that is longer than 5 characters: {state['input']}")
    return state

Let's assume we run the graph with an input that triggers the dynamic breakpoint and then attempt to resume the graph execution simply by passing in None for the input. 
# Attempt to continue the graph execution with no change to state after we hit the dynamic breakpoint 
for event in graph.stream(None, thread_config, stream_mode="values"):
    print(event)

The graph will interrupt again because this node will be re-run with the same graph state. We need to change the graph state such that the condition that triggers the dynamic breakpoint is no longer met. So, we can simply edit the graph state to an input that meets the condition of our dynamic breakpoint (< 5 characters) and re-run the node.
# Update the state to pass the dynamic breakpoint
graph.update_state(config=thread_config, values={"input": "foo"})
for event in graph.stream(None, thread_config, stream_mode="values"):
    print(event)

Alternatively, what if we want to keep our current input and skip the node (my_node) that performs the check? To do this, we can simply perform the graph update with as_node="my_node" and pass in None for the values. This will make no update the graph state, but run the update as my_node, effectively skipping the node and bypassing the dynamic breakpoint.
# This update will skip the node `my_node` altogether
graph.update_state(config=thread_config, values=None, as_node="my_node")
for event in graph.stream(None, thread_config, stream_mode="values"):
    print(event)

See our guide for a detailed how-to on doing this!
Interaction Patterns¶
Approval¶

Sometimes we want to approve certain steps in our agent's execution. 
We can interrupt our agent at a breakpoint prior to the step that we want to approve.
This is generally recommend for sensitive actions (e.g., using external APIs or writing to a database).
With persistence, we can surface the current agent state as well as the next step to a user for review and approval. 
If approved, the graph resumes execution from the last saved checkpoint, which is saved to the thread:
# Compile our graph with a checkpointer and a breakpoint before the step to approve
graph = builder.compile(checkpointer=checkpointer, interrupt_before=["node_2"])

# Run the graph up to the breakpoint
for event in graph.stream(inputs, thread, stream_mode="values"):
    print(event)

# ... Get human approval ...

# If approved, continue the graph execution from the last saved checkpoint
for event in graph.stream(None, thread, stream_mode="values"):
    print(event)

See our guide for a detailed how-to on doing this!
Editing¶

Sometimes we want to review and edit the agent's state. 
As with approval, we can interrupt our agent at a breakpoint prior to the step we want to check. 
We can surface the current state to a user and allow the user to edit the agent state.
This can, for example, be used to correct the agent if it made a mistake (e.g., see the section on tool calling below).
We can edit the graph state by forking the current checkpoint, which is saved to the thread.
We can then proceed with the graph from our forked checkpoint as done before. 
# Compile our graph with a checkpointer and a breakpoint before the step to review
graph = builder.compile(checkpointer=checkpointer, interrupt_before=["node_2"])

# Run the graph up to the breakpoint
for event in graph.stream(inputs, thread, stream_mode="values"):
    print(event)

# Review the state, decide to edit it, and create a forked checkpoint with the new state
graph.update_state(thread, {"state": "new state"})

# Continue the graph execution from the forked checkpoint
for event in graph.stream(None, thread, stream_mode="values"):
    print(event)

See this guide for a detailed how-to on doing this!
Input¶

Sometimes we want to explicitly get human input at a particular step in the graph. 
We can create a graph node designated for this (e.g., human_input in our example diagram).
As with approval and editing, we can interrupt our agent at a breakpoint prior to this node.
We can then perform a state update that includes the human input, just as we did with editing state.
But, we add one thing: 
We can use as_node=human_input with the state update to specify that the state update should be treated as a node.
The is subtle, but important: 
With editing, the user makes a decision about whether or not to edit the graph state.
With input, we explicitly define a node in our graph for collecting human input!
The state update with the human input then runs as this node.
# Compile our graph with a checkpointer and a breakpoint before the step to to collect human input
graph = builder.compile(checkpointer=checkpointer, interrupt_before=["human_input"])

# Run the graph up to the breakpoint
for event in graph.stream(inputs, thread, stream_mode="values"):
    print(event)

# Update the state with the user input as if it was the human_input node
graph.update_state(thread, {"user_input": user_input}, as_node="human_input")

# Continue the graph execution from the checkpoint created by the human_input node
for event in graph.stream(None, thread, stream_mode="values"):
    print(event)

See this guide for a detailed how-to on doing this!
Use-cases¶
Reviewing Tool Calls¶
Some user interaction patterns combine the above ideas.
For example, many agents use tool calling to make decisions. 
Tool calling presents a challenge because the agent must get two things right: 
(1) The name of the tool to call 
(2) The arguments to pass to the tool
Even if the tool call is correct, we may also want to apply discretion: 
(3) The tool call may be a sensitive operation that we want to approve 
With these points in mind, we can combine the above ideas to create a human-in-the-loop review of a tool call.
# Compile our graph with a checkpointer and a breakpoint before the step to to review the tool call from the LLM 
graph = builder.compile(checkpointer=checkpointer, interrupt_before=["human_review"])

# Run the graph up to the breakpoint
for event in graph.stream(inputs, thread, stream_mode="values"):
    print(event)

# Review the tool call and update it, if needed, as the human_review node
graph.update_state(thread, {"tool_call": "updated tool call"}, as_node="human_review")

# Otherwise, approve the tool call and proceed with the graph execution with no edits 

# Continue the graph execution from either: 
# (1) the forked checkpoint created by human_review or 
# (2) the checkpoint saved when the tool call was originally made (no edits in human_review)
for event in graph.stream(None, thread, stream_mode="values"):
    print(event)

See this guide for a detailed how-to on doing this!
Time Travel¶
When working with agents, we often want closely examine their decision making process: 
(1) Even when they arrive a desired final result, the reasoning that led to that result is often important to examine.
(2) When agents make mistakes, it is often valuable to understand why.
(3) In either of the above cases, it is useful to manually explore alternative decision making paths.
Collectively, we call these debugging concepts time-travel and they are composed of replaying and forking.
Replaying¶

Sometimes we want to simply replay past actions of an agent. 
Above, we showed the case of executing an agent from the current state (or checkpoint) of the graph.
We by simply passing in None for the input with a thread.
thread = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "1"}}
for event in graph.stream(None, thread, stream_mode="values"):
    print(event)

Now, we can modify this to replay past actions from a specific checkpoint by passing in the checkpoint ID.
To get a specific checkpoint ID, we can easily get all of the checkpoints in the thread and filter to the one we want.
all_checkpoints = []
for state in app.get_state_history(thread):
    all_checkpoints.append(state)

Each checkpoint has a unique ID, which we can use to replay from a specific checkpoint.
Assume from reviewing the checkpoints that we want to replay from one, xxx.
We just pass in the checkpoint ID when we run the graph.
config = {'configurable': {'thread_id': '1', 'checkpoint_id': 'xxx'}}
for event in graph.stream(None, config, stream_mode="values"):
    print(event)

Importantly, the graph knows which checkpoints have been previously executed. 
So, it will re-play any previously executed nodes rather than re-executing them.
See this additional conceptual guide for related context on replaying.
See see this guide for a detailed how-to on doing time-travel!
Forking¶

Sometimes we want to fork past actions of an agent, and explore different paths through the graph.
Editing, as discussed above, is exactly how we do this for the current state of the graph! 
But, what if we want to fork past states of the graph?
For example, let's say we want to edit a particular checkpoint, xxx.
We pass this checkpoint_id when we update the state of the graph.
config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "1", "checkpoint_id": "xxx"}}
graph.update_state(config, {"state": "updated state"}, )

This creates a new forked checkpoint, xxx-fork, which we can then run the graph from.
config = {'configurable': {'thread_id': '1', 'checkpoint_id': 'xxx-fork'}}
for event in graph.stream(None, config, stream_mode="values"):
    print(event)

See this additional conceptual guide for related context on forking.
See this guide for a detailed how-to on doing time-travel!

LangGraph Platform: Scalability & Resilience¶
LangGraph Platform is designed to scale horizontally with your workload. Each instance of the service is stateless, and keeps no resources in memory. The service is designed to gracefully handle new instances being added or removed, including hard shutdown cases.
Server scalability¶
As you add more instances to a service, they will share the HTTP load as long as an appropriate load balancer mechanism is placed in front of them. In most deployment modalities we configure a load balancer for the service automatically. In the “self-hosted without control plane” modality it’s your responsibility to add a load balancer. Since the instances are stateless any load balancing strategy will work, no session stickiness is needed, or recommended. Any instance of the server can communicate with any queue instance (through Redis PubSub), meaning that requests to cancel or stream an in-progress run can be handled by any arbitrary instance.
Queue scalability¶
As you add more instances to a service, they will increase run throughput linearly, as each instance is configured to handle a set number of concurrent runs (by default 10). Each attempt for each run will be handled by a single instance, with exactly-once semantics enforced through Postgres’s MVCC model (refer to section below for crash resilience details). Attempts that fail due to transient database errors are retried up to 3 times. We do not make use of long-lived transactions or locks, this enables us to make more efficient use of Postgres resources.
Resilience¶
While a run is being handled by a queue instance, a periodic heartbeat timestamp will be recorded in Redis by that queue worker.
When a graceful shutdown request is received (SIGINT) an instance enters shutdown mode, which

stops accepting new HTTP requests
gives any in-progress runs a limited number of seconds to finish (if not finished it will be put back in the queue)
stops the instance from picking up more runs from the queue

If a hard shutdown occurs, eg. due to a server crash, or an infra failure, any runs that were in progress will be picked up by a periodic sweeper task that looks for in-progress runs that have breached their heartbeat window, which will put them back in the queue for another instance to pick them up.
Postgres resilience¶
For deployment modalities where we manage the Postgres database we have periodic backups, continuously replicated standby replicas for automatic failover. Optionally, on request, we can also setup read replicas as well as other advanced failover capabilities.
All communication with Postgres implements retries for retry-able errors. If Postgres is momentarily unavailable, such as during a database restart, most/all traffic should continue to succeed. Prolonged failure of the Postgres instance will switch traffic to the failover replica. If the failover replica also fails before the primary is brought back online the service would become unavailable.
Redis resilience¶
All data that requires durable storage is stored in Postgres, not Redis. Redis is used only for ephemeral metadata, and communication between instances. Refer to the architecture page for more details on how we use Redis. Therefore we place no durability requirements on Redis.
All communication with Redis implements retries for retry-able errors. If Redis is momentarily unavailable, such as during a database restart, most/all traffic should continue to succeed. Prolonged failure of Redis will render the LGP service unavailable.

Human-in-the-loop¶
Human-in-the-loop functionality allows
you to involve humans in the decision-making process of your graph. These how-to guides show how to implement human-in-the-loop workflows in your graph.
Key workflows:

How to wait for user input: A basic example that shows how to implement a human-in-the-loop workflow in your graph using the interrupt function.
How to review tool calls: Incorporate human-in-the-loop for reviewing/editing/accepting tool call requests before they executed using the interrupt function.

Other methods:

How to add static breakpoints: Use for debugging purposes. For human-in-the-loop workflows, we recommend the interrupt function instead.
How to edit graph state: Edit graph state using graph.update_state method. Use this if implementing a human-in-the-loop workflow via static breakpoints.
How to add dynamic breakpoints with NodeInterrupt: Not recommended: Use the interrupt function instead.

See the below guides for how-to implement human-in-the-loop workflows with the
Functional API:

Tool calling¶
Tool calling is a type of
chat model API that accepts
tool schemas, along with messages, as input and returns invocations of those tools as
part of the output message.
These how-to guides show common patterns for tool calling with LangGraph:

How to review tool calls (Functional API)¶

Prerequisites
This guide assumes familiarity with the following:

Implementing human-in-the-loop workflows with interrupt
How to create a ReAct agent using the Functional API

This guide demonstrates how to implement human-in-the-loop workflows in a ReAct agent using the LangGraph Functional API.
We will build off of the agent created in the How to create a ReAct agent using the Functional API guide.
Specifically, we will demonstrate how to review tool calls generated by a chat model prior to their execution. This can be accomplished through use of the interrupt function at key points in our application.
Preview:
We will implement a simple function that reviews tool calls generated from our chat model and call it from inside our application's entrypoint:
def review_tool_call(tool_call: ToolCall) -> Union[ToolCall, ToolMessage]:
    """Review a tool call, returning a validated version."""
    human_review = interrupt(
        {
            "question": "Is this correct?",
            "tool_call": tool_call,
        }
    )
    review_action = human_review["action"]
    review_data = human_review.get("data")
    if review_action == "continue":
        return tool_call
    elif review_action == "update":
        updated_tool_call = {**tool_call, **{"args": review_data}}
        return updated_tool_call
    elif review_action == "feedback":
        return ToolMessage(
            content=review_data, name=tool_call["name"], tool_call_id=tool_call["id"]
        )

Setup¶
First, let's install the required packages and set our API keys:
%%capture --no-stderr
%pip install -U langgraph langchain-openai

import getpass
import os

def _set_env(var: str):
    if not os.environ.get(var):
        os.environ[var] = getpass.getpass(f"{var}: ")

_set_env("OPENAI_API_KEY")

Set up LangSmith for better debugging

         Sign up for LangSmith to quickly spot issues and improve the performance of your LangGraph projects. LangSmith lets you use trace data to debug, test, and monitor your LLM aps built with LangGraph — read more about how to get started in the docs. 
     

Define model and tools¶
Let's first define the tools and model we will use for our example. As in the ReAct agent guide, we will use a single place-holder tool that gets a description of the weather for a location.
We will use an OpenAI chat model for this example, but any model supporting tool-calling will suffice.
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from langchain_core.tools import tool

model = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o-mini")

@tool
def get_weather(location: str):
    """Call to get the weather from a specific location."""
    # This is a placeholder for the actual implementation
    if any([city in location.lower() for city in ["sf", "san francisco"]]):
        return "It's sunny!"
    elif "boston" in location.lower():
        return "It's rainy!"
    else:
        return f"I am not sure what the weather is in {location}"

tools = [get_weather]

API Reference: ChatOpenAI | tool
Define tasks¶
Our tasks are unchanged from the ReAct agent guide:

Call model: We want to query our chat model with a list of messages.
Call tool: If our model generates tool calls, we want to execute them.

from langchain_core.messages import ToolCall, ToolMessage
from langgraph.func import entrypoint, task

tools_by_name = {tool.name: tool for tool in tools}

@task
def call_model(messages):
    """Call model with a sequence of messages."""
    response = model.bind_tools(tools).invoke(messages)
    return response

@task
def call_tool(tool_call):
    tool = tools_by_name[tool_call["name"]]
    observation = tool.invoke(tool_call["args"])
    return ToolMessage(content=observation, tool_call_id=tool_call["id"])

API Reference: ToolCall | ToolMessage | entrypoint | task
Define entrypoint¶
To review tool calls before execution, we add a review_tool_call function that calls interrupt. When this function is called, execution will be paused until we issue a command to resume it.
Given a tool call, our function will interrupt for human review. At that point we can either:

Accept the tool call;
Revise the tool call and continue;
Generate a custom tool message (e.g., instructing the model to re-format its tool call).

We will demonstrate these three cases in the usage examples below.
from typing import Union

def review_tool_call(tool_call: ToolCall) -> Union[ToolCall, ToolMessage]:
    """Review a tool call, returning a validated version."""
    human_review = interrupt(
        {
            "question": "Is this correct?",
            "tool_call": tool_call,
        }
    )
    review_action = human_review["action"]
    review_data = human_review.get("data")
    if review_action == "continue":
        return tool_call
    elif review_action == "update":
        updated_tool_call = {**tool_call, **{"args": review_data}}
        return updated_tool_call
    elif review_action == "feedback":
        return ToolMessage(
            content=review_data, name=tool_call["name"], tool_call_id=tool_call["id"]
        )

We can now update our entrypoint to review the generated tool calls. If a tool call is accepted or revised, we execute in the same way as before. Otherwise, we just append the ToolMessage supplied by the human.

Tip
The results of prior tasks — in this case the initial model call — are persisted, so that they are not run again following the interrupt.

from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver
from langgraph.graph.message import add_messages
from langgraph.types import Command, interrupt

checkpointer = MemorySaver()

@entrypoint(checkpointer=checkpointer)
def agent(messages, previous):
    if previous is not None:
        messages = add_messages(previous, messages)

    llm_response = call_model(messages).result()
    while True:
        if not llm_response.tool_calls:
            break

        # Review tool calls
        tool_results = []
        tool_calls = []
        for i, tool_call in enumerate(llm_response.tool_calls):
            review = review_tool_call(tool_call)
            if isinstance(review, ToolMessage):
                tool_results.append(review)
            else:  # is a validated tool call
                tool_calls.append(review)
                if review != tool_call:
                    llm_response.tool_calls[i] = review  # update message

        # Execute remaining tool calls
        tool_result_futures = [call_tool(tool_call) for tool_call in tool_calls]
        remaining_tool_results = [fut.result() for fut in tool_result_futures]

        # Append to message list
        messages = add_messages(
            messages,
            [llm_response, *tool_results, *remaining_tool_results],
        )

        # Call model again
        llm_response = call_model(messages).result()

    # Generate final response
    messages = add_messages(messages, llm_response)
    return entrypoint.final(value=llm_response, save=messages)

API Reference: MemorySaver | add_messages | Command | interrupt
Usage¶
Let's demonstrate some scenarios.
def _print_step(step: dict) -> None:
    for task_name, result in step.items():
        if task_name == "agent":
            continue  # just stream from tasks
        print(f"\n{task_name}:")
        if task_name in ("__interrupt__", "review_tool_call"):
            print(result)
        else:
            result.pretty_print()

Accept a tool call¶
To accept a tool call, we just indicate in the data we provide in the Command that the tool call should pass through.
config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "1"}}

user_message = {"role": "user", "content": "What's the weather in san francisco?"}
print(user_message)

for step in agent.stream([user_message], config):
    _print_step(step)

{'role': 'user', 'content': "What's the weather in san francisco?"}

call_model:
==================================[1m Ai Message [0m==================================
Tool Calls:
  get_weather (call_Bh5cSwMqCpCxTjx7AjdrQTPd)
 Call ID: call_Bh5cSwMqCpCxTjx7AjdrQTPd
  Args:
    location: San Francisco

__interrupt__:
(Interrupt(value={'question': 'Is this correct?', 'tool_call': {'name': 'get_weather', 'args': {'location': 'San Francisco'}, 'id': 'call_Bh5cSwMqCpCxTjx7AjdrQTPd', 'type': 'tool_call'}}, resumable=True, ns=['agent:22fcc9cd-3573-b39b-eea7-272a025903e2'], when='during'),)

human_input = Command(resume={"action": "continue"})

for step in agent.stream(human_input, config):
    _print_step(step)

call_tool:
=================================[1m Tool Message [0m=================================

It's sunny!

call_model:
==================================[1m Ai Message [0m==================================

The weather in San Francisco is sunny!

Revise a tool call¶
To revise a tool call, we can supply updated arguments.
config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "2"}}

user_message = {"role": "user", "content": "What's the weather in san francisco?"}
print(user_message)

for step in agent.stream([user_message], config):
    _print_step(step)

{'role': 'user', 'content': "What's the weather in san francisco?"}

call_model:
==================================[1m Ai Message [0m==================================
Tool Calls:
  get_weather (call_b9h8e18FqH0IQm3NMoeYKz6N)
 Call ID: call_b9h8e18FqH0IQm3NMoeYKz6N
  Args:
    location: san francisco

__interrupt__:
(Interrupt(value={'question': 'Is this correct?', 'tool_call': {'name': 'get_weather', 'args': {'location': 'san francisco'}, 'id': 'call_b9h8e18FqH0IQm3NMoeYKz6N', 'type': 'tool_call'}}, resumable=True, ns=['agent:9559a81d-5720-dc19-a457-457bac7bdd83'], when='during'),)

human_input = Command(resume={"action": "update", "data": {"location": "SF, CA"}})

for step in agent.stream(human_input, config):
    _print_step(step)

call_tool:
=================================[1m Tool Message [0m=================================

It's sunny!

call_model:
==================================[1m Ai Message [0m==================================

The weather in San Francisco is sunny!

The LangSmith traces for this run are particularly informative:

In the trace before the interrupt, we generate a tool call for location "San Francisco".
In the trace after resuming, we see that the tool call in the message has been updated to "SF, CA".

Generate a custom ToolMessage¶
To Generate a custom ToolMessage, we supply the content of the message. In this case we will ask the model to reformat its tool call.
config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "3"}}

user_message = {"role": "user", "content": "What's the weather in san francisco?"}
print(user_message)

for step in agent.stream([user_message], config):
    _print_step(step)

{'role': 'user', 'content': "What's the weather in san francisco?"}

call_model:
==================================[1m Ai Message [0m==================================
Tool Calls:
  get_weather (call_VqGjKE7uu8HdWs9XuY1kMV18)
 Call ID: call_VqGjKE7uu8HdWs9XuY1kMV18
  Args:
    location: San Francisco

__interrupt__:
(Interrupt(value={'question': 'Is this correct?', 'tool_call': {'name': 'get_weather', 'args': {'location': 'San Francisco'}, 'id': 'call_VqGjKE7uu8HdWs9XuY1kMV18', 'type': 'tool_call'}}, resumable=True, ns=['agent:4b3b372b-9da3-70be-5c68-3d9317346070'], when='during'),)

human_input = Command(
    resume={
        "action": "feedback",
        "data": "Please format as <City>, <State>.",
    },
)

for step in agent.stream(human_input, config):
    _print_step(step)

call_model:
==================================[1m Ai Message [0m==================================
Tool Calls:
  get_weather (call_xoXkK8Cz0zIpvWs78qnXpvYp)
 Call ID: call_xoXkK8Cz0zIpvWs78qnXpvYp
  Args:
    location: San Francisco, CA

__interrupt__:
(Interrupt(value={'question': 'Is this correct?', 'tool_call': {'name': 'get_weather', 'args': {'location': 'San Francisco, CA'}, 'id': 'call_xoXkK8Cz0zIpvWs78qnXpvYp', 'type': 'tool_call'}}, resumable=True, ns=['agent:4b3b372b-9da3-70be-5c68-3d9317346070'], when='during'),)

Once it is re-formatted, we can accept it:
human_input = Command(resume={"action": "continue"})

for step in agent.stream(human_input, config):
    _print_step(step)

call_tool:
=================================[1m Tool Message [0m=================================

It's sunny!

call_model:
==================================[1m Ai Message [0m==================================

The weather in San Francisco, CA is sunny!

How to stream¶

Prerequisites
This guide assumes familiarity with the following:

Streaming
Chat Models

Streaming is crucial for enhancing the responsiveness of applications built on LLMs. By displaying output progressively, even before a complete response is ready, streaming significantly improves user experience (UX), particularly when dealing with the latency of LLMs.
LangGraph is built with first class support for streaming. There are several different ways to stream back outputs from a graph run:

"values": Emit all values in the state after each step.
"updates": Emit only the node names and updates returned by the nodes after each step.
    If multiple updates are made in the same step (e.g. multiple nodes are run) then those updates are emitted separately.
"custom": Emit custom data from inside nodes using StreamWriter.
"messages": Emit LLM messages token-by-token together with metadata for any LLM invocations inside nodes.
"debug": Emit debug events with as much information as possible for each step.

You can stream outputs from the graph by using graph.stream(..., stream_mode=<stream_mode>) method, e.g.:
SyncAsync

for chunk in graph.stream(inputs, stream_mode="updates"):
    print(chunk)

async for chunk in graph.astream(inputs, stream_mode="updates"):
    print(chunk)

You can also combine multiple streaming mode by providing a list to stream_mode parameter:
SyncAsync

for chunk in graph.stream(inputs, stream_mode=["updates", "custom"]):
    print(chunk)

async for chunk in graph.astream(inputs, stream_mode=["updates", "custom"]):
    print(chunk)

Setup¶
%%capture --no-stderr
%pip install --quiet -U langgraph langchain_openai

import getpass
import os

def _set_env(var: str):
    if not os.environ.get(var):
        os.environ[var] = getpass.getpass(f"{var}: ")

def generate_joke(state: State):
    return {"joke": f"This is a joke about {state['topic']}"}

graph = (
    StateGraph(State)

Use this to stream all values in the state after each step.
for chunk in graph.stream(
    {"topic": "ice cream"},
    stream_mode="values",
):
    print(chunk)

{'topic': 'ice cream'}
{'topic': 'ice cream and cats'}
{'topic': 'ice cream and cats', 'joke': 'This is a joke about ice cream and cats'}

Stream state updates from the nodes (stream_mode="updates")¶
Use this to stream only the state updates returned by the nodes after each step. The streamed outputs include the name of the node as well as the update.
for chunk in graph.stream(
    {"topic": "ice cream"},
    stream_mode="updates",
):
    print(chunk)

{'refine_topic': {'topic': 'ice cream and cats'}}
{'generate_joke': {'joke': 'This is a joke about ice cream and cats'}}

Stream debug events (stream_mode="debug")¶
Use this to stream debug events with as much information as possible for each step. Includes information about tasks that were scheduled to be executed as well as the results of the task executions.
for chunk in graph.stream(
    {"topic": "ice cream"},
    stream_mode="debug",
):
    print(chunk)

{'type': 'task', 'timestamp': '2025-01-28T22:06:34.789803+00:00', 'step': 1, 'payload': {'id': 'eb305d74-3460-9510-d516-beed71a63414', 'name': 'refine_topic', 'input': {'topic': 'ice cream'}, 'triggers': ['start:refine_topic']}}
{'type': 'task_result', 'timestamp': '2025-01-28T22:06:34.790013+00:00', 'step': 1, 'payload': {'id': 'eb305d74-3460-9510-d516-beed71a63414', 'name': 'refine_topic', 'error': None, 'result': [('topic', 'ice cream and cats')], 'interrupts': []}}

Stream LLM tokens (stream_mode="messages")¶
Use this to stream LLM messages token-by-token together with metadata for any LLM invocations inside nodes or tasks. Let's modify the above example to include LLM calls:
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o-mini")

def generate_joke(state: State):
    llm_response = llm.invoke(
        [
            {"role": "user", "content": f"Generate a joke about {state['topic']}"}
        ]
    )
    return {"joke": llm_response.content}

graph = (
    StateGraph(State)
    .add_node(refine_topic)
    .add_node(generate_joke)
    .add_edge(START, "refine_topic")
    .add_edge("refine_topic", "generate_joke")
    .compile()
)

API Reference: ChatOpenAI
for message_chunk, metadata in graph.stream(
    {"topic": "ice cream"},
    stream_mode="messages",
):
    if message_chunk.content:
        print(message_chunk.content, end="|", flush=True)

Why| did| the| cat| sit| on| the| ice| cream| cone|?

|Because| it| wanted| to| be| a| "|p|urr|-f|ect|"| scoop|!| 🍦|🐱|

metadata

{'langgraph_step': 2,
 'langgraph_node': 'generate_joke',
 'langgraph_triggers': ['refine_topic'],
 'langgraph_path': ('__pregel_pull', 'generate_joke'),

 'ls_provider': 'openai',
 'ls_model_name': 'gpt-4o-mini',
 'ls_model_type': 'chat',
 'ls_temperature': 0.7}

Stream custom data (stream_mode="custom")¶
Use this to stream custom data from inside nodes using StreamWriter.
from langgraph.types import StreamWriter

def generate_joke(state: State, writer: StreamWriter):
    writer({"custom_key": "Writing custom data while generating a joke"})
    return {"joke": f"This is a joke about {state['topic']}"}

graph = (
    StateGraph(State)
    .add_node(refine_topic)
    .add_node(generate_joke)
    .add_edge(START, "refine_topic")
    .add_edge("refine_topic", "generate_joke")
    .compile()
)

API Reference: StreamWriter
for chunk in graph.stream(
    {"topic": "ice cream"},
    stream_mode="custom",
):
    print(chunk)

{'custom_key': 'Writing custom data while generating a joke'}

Configure multiple streaming modes¶
Use this to combine multiple streaming modes. The outputs are streamed as tuples (stream_mode, streamed_output).
for stream_mode, chunk in graph.stream(
    {"topic": "ice cream"},
    stream_mode=["updates", "custom"],
):
    print(f"Stream mode: {stream_mode}")
    print(chunk)
    print("\n")

Stream mode: updates
{'refine_topic': {'topic': 'ice cream and cats'}}

Stream mode: custom
{'custom_key': 'Writing custom data while generating a joke'}

Stream mode: updates
{'generate_joke': {'joke': 'This is a joke about ice cream and cats'}}

How to stream from subgraphs¶

Prerequisites
This guide assumes familiarity with the following:

Subgraphs
Chat Models

If you have created a graph with subgraphs, you may wish to stream outputs from those subgraphs. To do so, you can specify subgraphs=True in parent graph's .stream() method:
for chunk in parent_graph.stream(
    {"foo": "foo"},
    subgraphs=True
):
    print(chunk)

Setup¶
First let's install the required packages
%%capture --no-stderr
%pip install -U langgraph

Set up LangSmith for LangGraph development

        Sign up for LangSmith to quickly spot issues and improve the performance of your LangGraph projects. LangSmith lets you use trace data to debug, test, and monitor your LLM apps built with LangGraph — read more about how to get started here. 
    

Example¶
Let's define a simple example:
from langgraph.graph import START, StateGraph
from typing import TypedDict

# Define subgraph
class SubgraphState(TypedDict):
    foo: str  # note that this key is shared with the parent graph state
    bar: str

def subgraph_node_1(state: SubgraphState):
    return {"bar": "bar"}

def subgraph_node_2(state: SubgraphState):
    return {"foo": state["foo"] + state["bar"]}

subgraph_builder = StateGraph(SubgraphState)
subgraph_builder.add_node(subgraph_node_1)
subgraph_builder.add_node(subgraph_node_2)
subgraph_builder.add_edge(START, "subgraph_node_1")
subgraph_builder.add_edge("subgraph_node_1", "subgraph_node_2")
subgraph = subgraph_builder.compile()

# Define parent graph
class ParentState(TypedDict):
    foo: str

def node_1(state: ParentState):
    return {"foo": "hi! " + state["foo"]}

builder = StateGraph(ParentState)
builder.add_node("node_1", node_1)
builder.add_node("node_2", subgraph)
builder.add_edge(START, "node_1")
builder.add_edge("node_1", "node_2")
graph = builder.compile()

API Reference: START | StateGraph
Let's now stream the outputs from the graph:
for chunk in graph.stream({"foo": "foo"}, stream_mode="updates"):
    print(chunk)

{'node_1': {'foo': 'hi! foo'}}
{'node_2': {'foo': 'hi! foobar'}}

You can see that we're only emitting the updates from the parent graph nodes (node_1 and node_2). To emit the updates from the subgraph nodes you can specify subgraphs=True:
for chunk in graph.stream(
    {"foo": "foo"},
    stream_mode="updates",
    subgraphs=True,
):
    print(chunk)

((), {'node_1': {'foo': 'hi! foo'}})
(('node_2:b692b345-cfb3-b709-628c-f0ba9608f72e',), {'subgraph_node_1': {'bar': 'bar'}})
(('node_2:b692b345-cfb3-b709-628c-f0ba9608f72e',), {'subgraph_node_2': {'foo': 'hi! foobar'}})
((), {'node_2': {'foo': 'hi! foobar'}})

Voila! The streamed outputs now contain updates from both the parent graph and the subgraph. Note that we are receiving not just the node updates, but we also the namespaces which tell us what graph (or subgraph) we are streaming from.

How to use subgraphs¶

Prerequisites

        This guide assumes familiarity with the following:
        

                    Subgraphs
                

                    State
                

Subgraphs allow you to build complex systems with multiple components that are themselves graphs. A common use case for using subgraphs is building multi-agent systems.
The main question when adding subgraphs is how the parent graph and subgraph communicate, i.e. how they pass the state between each other during the graph execution. There are two scenarios:

parent graph and subgraph share schema keys. In this case, you can add a node with the compiled subgraph
parent graph and subgraph have different schemas. In this case, you have to add a node function that invokes the subgraph: this is useful when the parent graph and the subgraph have different state schemas and you need to transform state before or after calling the subgraph

Below we show to to add subgraphs for each scenario.

Setup¶
First, let's install the required packages
%%capture --no-stderr
%pip install -U langgraph

Set up LangSmith for LangGraph development

        Sign up for LangSmith to quickly spot issues and improve the performance of your LangGraph projects. LangSmith lets you use trace data to debug, test, and monitor your LLM apps built with LangGraph — read more about how to get started here. 
    

Add a node with the compiled subgraph¶
A common case is for the parent graph and subgraph to communicate over a shared state key (channel). For example, in multi-agent systems, the agents often communicate over a shared messages key.
If your subgraph shares state keys with the parent graph, you can follow these steps to add it to your graph:

Define the subgraph workflow (subgraph_builder in the example below) and compile it
Pass compiled subgraph to the .add_node method when defining the parent graph workflow

Let's take a look at a simple example. 
from langgraph.graph import START, StateGraph
from typing import TypedDict

# Define subgraph
class SubgraphState(TypedDict):
    foo: str  # note that this key is shared with the parent graph state
    bar: str

def subgraph_node_1(state: SubgraphState):
    return {"bar": "bar"}

def subgraph_node_2(state: SubgraphState):
    # note that this node is using a state key ('bar') that is only available in the subgraph
    # and is sending update on the shared state key ('foo')
    return {"foo": state["foo"] + state["bar"]}

subgraph_builder = StateGraph(SubgraphState)
subgraph_builder.add_node(subgraph_node_1)
subgraph_builder.add_node(subgraph_node_2)
subgraph_builder.add_edge(START, "subgraph_node_1")
subgraph_builder.add_edge("subgraph_node_1", "subgraph_node_2")
subgraph = subgraph_builder.compile()

# Define parent graph
class ParentState(TypedDict):
    foo: str

def node_1(state: ParentState):
    return {"foo": "hi! " + state["foo"]}

builder = StateGraph(ParentState)
builder.add_node("node_1", node_1)
# note that we're adding the compiled subgraph as a node to the parent graph
builder.add_node("node_2", subgraph)
builder.add_edge(START, "node_1")
builder.add_edge("node_1", "node_2")
graph = builder.compile()

API Reference: START | StateGraph
for chunk in graph.stream({"foo": "foo"}):
    print(chunk)

{'node_1': {'foo': 'hi! foo'}}
{'node_2': {'foo': 'hi! foobar'}}

You can see that the final output from the parent graph includes the results of subgraph invocation (i.e. string "bar"). If you would like to see outputs from the subgraph, you can specify subgraphs=True when streaming. See more on streaming from subgraphs in this how-to guide.
for chunk in graph.stream({"foo": "foo"}, subgraphs=True):
    print(chunk)

((), {'node_1': {'foo': 'hi! foo'}})
(('node_2:e58e5673-a661-ebb0-70d4-e298a7fc28b7',), {'subgraph_node_1': {'bar': 'bar'}})
(('node_2:e58e5673-a661-ebb0-70d4-e298a7fc28b7',), {'subgraph_node_2': {'foo': 'hi! foobar'}})
((), {'node_2': {'foo': 'hi! foobar'}})

Add a node function that invokes the subgraph¶
For more complex systems you might want to define subgraphs that have a completely different schema from the parent graph (no shared keys). For example, in a multi-agent RAG system, a search agent might only need to keep track of queries and retrieved documents.
If that's the case for your application, you need to define a node function that invokes the subgraph. This function needs to transform the input (parent) state to the subgraph state before invoking the subgraph, and transform the results back to the parent state before returning the state update from the node.
Below we show how to modify our original example to call a subgraph from inside the node.

Warning
You cannot invoke more than one subgraph inside the same node.

# Define subgraph
class SubgraphState(TypedDict):
    # note that none of these keys are shared with the parent graph state
    bar: str
    baz: str

def subgraph_node_1(state: SubgraphState):
    return {"baz": "baz"}

def subgraph_node_2(state: SubgraphState):
    return {"bar": state["bar"] + state["baz"]}

subgraph_builder = StateGraph(SubgraphState)
subgraph_builder.add_node(subgraph_node_1)
subgraph_builder.add_node(subgraph_node_2)
subgraph_builder.add_edge(START, "subgraph_node_1")
subgraph_builder.add_edge("subgraph_node_1", "subgraph_node_2")
subgraph = subgraph_builder.compile()

# Define parent graph
class ParentState(TypedDict):
    foo: str

def node_1(state: ParentState):
    return {"foo": "hi! " + state["foo"]}

def node_2(state: ParentState):
    # transform the state to the subgraph state
    response = subgraph.invoke({"bar": state["foo"]})
    # transform response back to the parent state
    return {"foo": response["bar"]}

builder = StateGraph(ParentState)
builder.add_node("node_1", node_1)
# note that instead of using the compiled subgraph we are using `node_2` function that is calling the subgraph
builder.add_node("node_2", node_2)
builder.add_edge(START, "node_1")
builder.add_edge("node_1", "node_2")
graph = builder.compile()

for chunk in graph.stream({"foo": "foo"}, subgraphs=True):
    print(chunk)

((), {'node_1': {'foo': 'hi! foo'}})
(('node_2:c47d7ea3-7798-87c4-adf4-2543a91d6891',), {'subgraph_node_1': {'baz': 'baz'}})
(('node_2:c47d7ea3-7798-87c4-adf4-2543a91d6891',), {'subgraph_node_2': {'bar': 'hi! foobaz'}})
((), {'node_2': {'foo': 'hi! foobaz'}})

How to stream data from within a tool¶

Prerequisites
This guide assumes familiarity with the following:

Streaming
Chat Models
Tools

If your graph calls tools that use LLMs or any other streaming APIs, you might want to surface partial results during the execution of the tool, especially if the tool takes a longer time to run.

To stream arbitrary data from inside a tool you can use stream_mode="custom" and get_stream_writer():
from langgraph.config import get_stream_writer

def tool(tool_arg: str):
    writer = get_stream_writer()
    for chunk in custom_data_stream():
        # stream any arbitrary data
        writer(chunk)
    ...

for chunk in graph.stream(
    inputs,
    stream_mode="custom"
):
    print(chunk)

To stream LLM tokens generated by a tool calling an LLM you can use stream_mode="messages":
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, MessagesState
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

model = ChatOpenAI()

def tool(tool_arg: str):
    model.invoke(tool_arg)
    ...

def call_tools(state: MessagesState):
    tool_call = get_tool_call(state)
    tool_result = tool(**tool_call["args"])
    ...

graph = (
    StateGraph(MessagesState)
    .add_node(call_tools)
    ...
    .compile()

for msg, metadata in graph.stream(
    inputs,
    stream_mode="messages"
):
    print(msg)

Using without LangChain
If you need to stream data from inside tools without using LangChain, you can use stream_mode="custom". Check out the example below to learn more.

Async in Python < 3.11
When using Python < 3.11 with async code, please ensure you manually pass the RunnableConfig through to the chat model when invoking it like so: model.ainvoke(..., config).
The stream method collects all events from your nested code using a streaming tracer passed as a callback. In 3.11 and above, this is automatically handled via contextvars; prior to 3.11, asyncio's tasks lacked proper contextvar support, meaning that the callbacks will only propagate if you manually pass the config through. We do this in the call_model function below.

Setup¶
First, let's install the required packages and set our API keys
%%capture --no-stderr
%pip install -U langgraph langchain-openai

import getpass
import os

def _set_env(var: str):
    if not os.environ.get(var):
        os.environ[var] = getpass.getpass(f"{var}: ")

_set_env("OPENAI_API_KEY")

OPENAI_API_KEY:  ········

        Sign up for LangSmith to quickly spot issues and improve the performance of your LangGraph projects. LangSmith lets you use trace data to debug, test, and monitor your LLM apps built with LangGraph — read more about how to get started here. 
    

Streaming custom data¶
We'll use a prebuilt ReAct agent for this guide:
from langchain_core.tools import tool
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

from langgraph.prebuilt import create_react_agent
from langgraph.config import get_stream_writer

@tool
async def get_items(place: str) -> str:
    """Use this tool to list items one might find in a place you're asked about."""
    writer = get_stream_writer()

    # this can be replaced with any actual streaming logic that you might have
    items = ["books", "penciles", "pictures"]
    for chunk in items:
        writer({"custom_tool_data": chunk})

    return ", ".join(items)

llm = ChatOpenAI(model_name="gpt-4o-mini")
tools = [get_items]
# contains `agent` (tool-calling LLM) and `tools` (tool executor) nodes
agent = create_react_agent(llm, tools=tools)

API Reference: tool | ChatOpenAI | create_react_agent
Let's now invoke our agent with an input that requires a tool call:
inputs = {
    "messages": [  
        {"role": "user", "content": "what items are in the office?"}
    ]
}
async for chunk in agent.astream(
    inputs,
    stream_mode="custom",
):
    print(chunk)

{'custom_tool_data': 'books'}
{'custom_tool_data': 'penciles'}
{'custom_tool_data': 'pictures'}

Streaming LLM tokens¶
from langchain_core.messages import AIMessageChunk
from langchain_core.runnables import RunnableConfig

@tool
async def get_items(
    place: str,
    # Manually accept config (needed for Python <= 3.10)
    config: RunnableConfig,
) -> str:
    """Use this tool to list items one might find in a place you're asked about."""
    # Attention: when using async, you should be invoking the LLM using ainvoke!
    # If you fail to do so, streaming will NOT work.
    response = await llm.ainvoke(
        [
            {
                "role": "user",
                "content": (
                    f"Can you tell me what kind of items i might find in the following place: '{place}'. "
                    "List at least 3 such items separating them by a comma. And include a brief description of each item."
                ),
            }
        ],
        config,
    )
    return response.content

tools = [get_items]
# contains `agent` (tool-calling LLM) and `tools` (tool executor) nodes
agent = create_react_agent(llm, tools=tools)

API Reference: AIMessageChunk | RunnableConfig
inputs = {
    "messages": [  
        {"role": "user", "content": "what items are in the bedroom?"}
    ]
}
async for msg, metadata in agent.astream(
    inputs,
    stream_mode="messages",
):
    if (
        isinstance(msg, AIMessageChunk)
        and msg.content
        # Stream all messages from the tool node
        and metadata["langgraph_node"] == "tools"
    ):
        print(msg.content, end="|", flush=True)

Certainly|!| Here| are| three| items| you| might| find| in| a| bedroom|:

|1|.| **|Bed|**|:| The| central| piece| of| furniture| in| a| bedroom|,| typically| consisting| of| a| mattress| supported| by| a| frame|.| It| is| designed| for| sleeping| and| can| vary| in| size| from| twin| to| king|.| Beds| often| have| bedding|,| including| sheets|,| pillows|,| and| comfort|ers|,| to| enhance| comfort|.

|2|.| **|D|resser|**|:| A| piece| of| furniture| with| drawers| used| for| storing| clothing| and| personal| items|.| Dress|ers| often| have| a| flat| surface| on| top|,| which| can| be| used| for| decorative| items|,| a| mirror|,| or| personal| accessories|.| They| help| keep| the| bedroom| organized| and| clutter|-free|.

|3|.| **|Night|stand|**|:| A| small| table| or| cabinet| placed| beside| the| bed|,| used| for| holding| items| such| as| a| lamp|,| alarm| clock|,| books|,| or| personal| items|.| Night|stands| provide| convenience| for| easy| access| to| essentials| during| the| night|,| adding| functionality| and| style| to| the| bedroom| decor|.|

Example without LangChain¶
You can also stream data from within tool invocations without using LangChain. Below example demonstrates how to do it for a graph with a single tool-executing node. We'll leave it as an exercise for the reader to implement ReAct agent from scratch without using LangChain.

from openai import AsyncOpenAI

openai_client = AsyncOpenAI()

CONTENT:
How to stream LLM tokens from your graph¶

Prerequisites
This guide assumes familiarity with the following:

Streaming
Chat Models

When building LLM applications with LangGraph, you might want to stream individual LLM tokens from the LLM calls inside LangGraph nodes. You can do so via graph.stream(..., stream_mode="messages"):
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

model = ChatOpenAI()
def call_model(state: State):
    model.invoke(...)
    ...

graph = (
    StateGraph(State)
    .add_node(call_model)
    ...
    .compile()

for msg, metadata in graph.stream(inputs, stream_mode="messages"):
    print(msg)

The streamed outputs will be tuples of (message chunk, metadata):

message chunk is the token streamed by the LLM
metadata is a dictionary with information about the graph node where the LLM was called as well as the LLM invocation metadata

Using without LangChain
If you need to stream LLM tokens without using LangChain, you can use stream_mode="custom" to stream the outputs from LLM provider clients directly. Check out the example below to learn more.

Async in Python < 3.11
When using Python < 3.11 with async code, please ensure you manually pass the RunnableConfig through to the chat model when invoking it like so: model.ainvoke(..., config).
The stream method collects all events from your nested code using a streaming tracer passed as a callback. In 3.11 and above, this is automatically handled via contextvars; prior to 3.11, asyncio's tasks lacked proper contextvar support, meaning that the callbacks will only propagate if you manually pass the config through. We do this in the call_model function below.

Setup¶
First we need to install the packages required
%%capture --no-stderr
%pip install --quiet -U langgraph langchain_openai

Next, we need to set API keys for OpenAI (the LLM we will use).
import getpass
import os

def _set_env(var: str):
    if not os.environ.get(var):
        os.environ[var] = getpass.getpass(f"{var}: ")

_set_env("OPENAI_API_KEY")

Set up LangSmith for LangGraph development

        Sign up for LangSmith to quickly spot issues and improve the performance of your LangGraph projects. LangSmith lets you use trace data to debug, test, and monitor your LLM apps built with LangGraph — read more about how to get started here. 
    

Note
Note that in call_model(state: State, config: RunnableConfig): below, we a) accept the RunnableConfig in the node function and b) pass it in as the second arg for model.ainvoke(..., config). This is optional for python >= 3.11.

Example¶
Below we demonstrate an example with two LLM calls in a single node.
from typing import TypedDict
from langgraph.graph import START, StateGraph, MessagesState
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

# Note: we're adding the tags here to be able to filter the model outputs down the line
joke_model = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o-mini", tags=["joke"])
poem_model = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o-mini", tags=["poem"])

class State(TypedDict):
    topic: str
    joke: str
    poem: str

async def call_model(state, config):
    topic = state["topic"]
    print("Writing joke...")
    # Note: Passing the config through explicitly is required for python < 3.11
    # Since context var support wasn't added before then: https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-task.html#creating-tasks
    joke_response = await joke_model.ainvoke(
        [{"role": "user", "content": f"Write a joke about {topic}"}],
        config,
    )
    print("\n\nWriting poem...")
    poem_response = await poem_model.ainvoke(
        [{"role": "user", "content": f"Write a short poem about {topic}"}],
        config,
    )
    return {"joke": joke_response.content, "poem": poem_response.content}

graph = StateGraph(State).add_node(call_model).add_edge(START, "call_model").compile()

API Reference: START | StateGraph | ChatOpenAI
async for msg, metadata in graph.astream(
    {"topic": "cats"},
    stream_mode="messages",
):
    if msg.content:
        print(msg.content, end="|", flush=True)

{'langgraph_step': 1,
 'langgraph_node': 'call_model',

 'ls_model_type': 'chat',
 'ls_temperature': 0.7,
 'tags': ['poem']}

Filter to specific LLM invocation¶
You can see that we're streaming tokens from all of the LLM invocations. Let's now filter the streamed tokens to include only a specific LLM invocation. We can use the streamed metadata and filter events using the tags we've added to the LLMs previously:
async for msg, metadata in graph.astream(
    {"topic": "cats"},
    stream_mode="messages",
):
    if msg.content and "joke" in metadata.get("tags", []):
        print(msg.content, end="|", flush=True)

Writing joke...

Example without LangChain¶
from openai import AsyncOpenAI

openai_client = AsyncOpenAI()
model_name = "gpt-4o-mini"

async def stream_tokens(model_name: str, messages: list[dict]):
    response = await openai_client.chat.completions.create(
        messages=messages, model=model_name, stream=True
    )

    role = None
    async for chunk in response:
        delta = chunk.choices[0].delta

        if delta.role is not None:
            role = delta.role

        if delta.content:
            yield {"role": role, "content": delta.content}

async def call_model(state, config, writer):
    topic = state["topic"]
    joke = ""
    poem = ""

    print("Writing joke...")
    async for msg_chunk in stream_tokens(
        model_name, [{"role": "user", "content": f"Write a joke about {topic}"}]
    ):
        joke += msg_chunk["content"]
        metadata = {**config["metadata"], "tags": ["joke"]}
        chunk_to_stream = (msg_chunk, metadata)
        writer(chunk_to_stream)

    print("\n\nWriting poem...")
    async for msg_chunk in stream_tokens(
        model_name, [{"role": "user", "content": f"Write a short poem about {topic}"}]
    ):
        poem += msg_chunk["content"]
        metadata = {**config["metadata"], "tags": ["poem"]}
        chunk_to_stream = (msg_chunk, metadata)
        writer(chunk_to_stream)

    return {"joke": joke, "poem": poem}

graph = StateGraph(State).add_node(call_model).add_edge(START, "call_model").compile()

stream_mode="custom"
When streaming LLM tokens without LangChain, we recommend using stream_mode="custom". This allows you to explicitly control which data from the LLM provider APIs to include in LangGraph streamed outputs, including any additional metadata.

async for msg, metadata in graph.astream(
    {"topic": "cats"},
    stream_mode="custom",
):
    print(msg["content"], end="|", flush=True)

How to disable streaming for models that don't support it¶

Prerequisites

        This guide assumes familiarity with the following:
        

                    streaming
                

                    Chat Models
                

Some chat models, including the new O1 models from OpenAI (depending on when you're reading this), do not support streaming. This can lead to issues when using the astream_events API, as it calls models in streaming mode, expecting streaming to function properly.
In this guide, we’ll show you how to disable streaming for models that don’t support it, ensuring they they're never called in streaming mode, even when invoked through the astream_events API.
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from langgraph.graph import MessagesState
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END

llm = ChatOpenAI(model="o1-preview", temperature=1)

graph_builder = StateGraph(MessagesState)

def chatbot(state: MessagesState):
    return {"messages": [llm.invoke(state["messages"])]}

graph_builder.add_node("chatbot", chatbot)
graph_builder.add_edge(START, "chatbot")
graph_builder.add_edge("chatbot", END)
graph = graph_builder.compile()

API Reference: ChatOpenAI | StateGraph | START | END
from IPython.display import Image, display

display(Image(graph.get_graph().draw_mermaid_png()))

Without disabling streaming¶
Now that we've defined our graph, let's try to call astream_events without disabling streaming. This should throw an error because the o1 model does not support streaming natively:
input = {"messages": {"role": "user", "content": "how many r's are in strawberry?"}}
try:
    async for event in graph.astream_events(input, version="v2"):
        if event["event"] == "on_chat_model_end":
            print(event["data"]["output"].content, end="", flush=True)
except:
    print("Streaming not supported!")

Streaming not supported!

An error occurred as we expected, luckily there is an easy fix!
Disabling streaming¶
Now without making any changes to our graph, let's set the disable_streaming parameter on our model to be True which will solve the problem:
llm = ChatOpenAI(model="o1-preview", temperature=1, disable_streaming=True)

graph_builder = StateGraph(MessagesState)

def chatbot(state: MessagesState):
    return {"messages": [llm.invoke(state["messages"])]}

graph_builder.add_node("chatbot", chatbot)
graph_builder.add_edge(START, "chatbot")
graph_builder.add_edge("chatbot", END)
graph = graph_builder.compile()

And now, rerunning with the same input, we should see no errors:
input = {"messages": {"role": "user", "content": "how many r's are in strawberry?"}}
async for event in graph.astream_events(input, version="v2"):
    if event["event"] == "on_chat_model_end":
        print(event["data"]["output"].content, end="", flush=True)

There are three "r"s in the word "strawberry".

How to stream LLM tokens from specific nodes¶

Prerequisites
This guide assumes familiarity with the following:

Streaming
Chat Models

A common use case when streaming LLM tokens is to only stream them from specific nodes. To do so, you can use stream_mode="messages" and filter the outputs by the langgraph_node field in the streamed metadata:
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

model = ChatOpenAI()

def node_a(state: State):
    model.invoke(...)
    ...

def node_b(state: State):
    model.invoke(...)
    ...

graph = (
    StateGraph(State)
    .add_node(node_a)
    .add_node(node_b)
    ...
    .compile()

for msg, metadata in graph.stream(
    inputs,
    stream_mode="messages"
):
    # stream from 'node_a'
    if metadata["langgraph_node"] == "node_a":
        print(msg)

Streaming from a specific LLM invocation
If you need to instead filter streamed LLM tokens to a specific LLM invocation, check out this guide

Setup¶
First we need to install the packages required
%%capture --no-stderr
%pip install --quiet -U langgraph langchain_openai

import getpass
import os

def _set_env(var: str):
    if not os.environ.get(var):
        os.environ[var] = getpass.getpass(f"{var}: ")

_set_env("OPENAI_API_KEY")

Example¶
from typing import TypedDict
from langgraph.graph import START, StateGraph, MessagesState
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

model = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o-mini")

class State(TypedDict):
    topic: str
    joke: str
    poem: str

def write_joke(state: State):
    topic = state["topic"]
    joke_response = model.invoke(
        [{"role": "user", "content": f"Write a joke about {topic}"}]
    )
    return {"joke": joke_response.content}

def write_poem(state: State):
    topic = state["topic"]
    poem_response = model.invoke(
        [{"role": "user", "content": f"Write a short poem about {topic}"}]
    )
    return {"poem": poem_response.content}

graph = (
    StateGraph(State)
    .add_node(write_joke)
    .add_node(write_poem)
    # write both the joke and the poem concurrently
    .add_edge(START, "write_joke")
    .add_edge(START, "write_poem")
    .compile()
)

        print(msg.content, end="|", flush=True)

How to stream LLM tokens from your graph¶

Prerequisites
This guide assumes familiarity with the following:

Streaming
Chat Models

When building LLM applications with LangGraph, you might want to stream individual LLM tokens from the LLM calls inside LangGraph nodes. You can do so via graph.stream(..., stream_mode="messages"):
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

model = ChatOpenAI()
def call_model(state: State):
    model.invoke(...)
    ...

graph = (
    StateGraph(State)
    .add_node(call_model)
    ...
    .compile()

for msg, metadata in graph.stream(inputs, stream_mode="messages"):
    print(msg)

The streamed outputs will be tuples of (message chunk, metadata):

message chunk is the token streamed by the LLM
metadata is a dictionary with information about the graph node where the LLM was called as well as the LLM invocation metadata

Using without LangChain
If you need to stream LLM tokens without using LangChain, you can use stream_mode="custom" to stream the outputs from LLM provider clients directly. Check out the example below to learn more.

Async in Python < 3.11
When using Python < 3.11 with async code, please ensure you manually pass the RunnableConfig through to the chat model when invoking it like so: model.ainvoke(..., config).
The stream method collects all events from your nested code using a streaming tracer passed as a callback. In 3.11 and above, this is automatically handled via contextvars; prior to 3.11, asyncio's tasks lacked proper contextvar support, meaning that the callbacks will only propagate if you manually pass the config through. We do this in the call_model function below.

Setup¶
First we need to install the packages required
%%capture --no-stderr
%pip install --quiet -U langgraph langchain_openai

Next, we need to set API keys for OpenAI (the LLM we will use).
import getpass
import os

def _set_env(var: str):
    if not os.environ.get(var):
        os.environ[var] = getpass.getpass(f"{var}: ")

_set_env("OPENAI_API_KEY")

Note
Note that in call_model(state: State, config: RunnableConfig): below, we a) accept the RunnableConfig in the node function and b) pass it in as the second arg for model.ainvoke(..., config). This is optional for python >= 3.11.

Example¶
Below we demonstrate an example with two LLM calls in a single node.
from typing import TypedDict
from langgraph.graph import START, StateGraph, MessagesState
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

# Note: we're adding the tags here to be able to filter the model outputs down the line
joke_model = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o-mini", tags=["joke"])
poem_model = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o-mini", tags=["poem"])

class State(TypedDict):
    topic: str
    joke: str
    poem: str

async def call_model(state, config):
    topic = state["topic"]
    print("Writing joke...")
    # Note: Passing the config through explicitly is required for python < 3.11
    # Since context var support wasn't added before then: https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-task.html#creating-tasks
    joke_response = await joke_model.ainvoke(
        [{"role": "user", "content": f"Write a joke about {topic}"}],
        config,
    )
    print("\n\nWriting poem...")
    poem_response = await poem_model.ainvoke(
        [{"role": "user", "content": f"Write a short poem about {topic}"}],
        config,
    )
    return {"joke": joke_response.content, "poem": poem_response.content}

graph = StateGraph(State).add_node(call_model).add_edge(START, "call_model").compile()

API Reference: START | StateGraph | ChatOpenAI
async for msg, metadata in graph.astream(
    {"topic": "cats"},
    stream_mode="messages",
):
    if msg.content:
        print(msg.content, end="|", flush=True)

Filter to specific LLM invocation¶
You can see that we're streaming tokens from all of the LLM invocations. Let's now filter the streamed tokens to include only a specific LLM invocation. We can use the streamed metadata and filter events using the tags we've added to the LLMs previously:
async for msg, metadata in graph.astream(
    {"topic": "cats"},
    stream_mode="messages",
):
    if msg.content and "joke" in metadata.get("tags", []):
        print(msg.content, end="|", flush=True)

Writing joke...

Example without LangChain¶
from openai import AsyncOpenAI

openai_client = AsyncOpenAI()
model_name = "gpt-4o-mini"

async def stream_tokens(model_name: str, messages: list[dict]):
    response = await openai_client.chat.completions.create(
        messages=messages, model=model_name, stream=True
    )

    role = None
    async for chunk in response:
        delta = chunk.choices[0].delta

        if delta.role is not None:
            role = delta.role

        if delta.content:
            yield {"role": role, "content": delta.content}

async def call_model(state, config, writer):
    topic = state["topic"]
    joke = ""
    poem = ""

    print("Writing joke...")
    async for msg_chunk in stream_tokens(
        model_name, [{"role": "user", "content": f"Write a joke about {topic}"}]
    ):
        joke += msg_chunk["content"]
        metadata = {**config["metadata"], "tags": ["joke"]}
        chunk_to_stream = (msg_chunk, metadata)
        writer(chunk_to_stream)

    print("\n\nWriting poem...")
    async for msg_chunk in stream_tokens(
        model_name, [{"role": "user", "content": f"Write a short poem about {topic}"}]
    ):
        poem += msg_chunk["content"]
        metadata = {**config["metadata"], "tags": ["poem"]}
        chunk_to_stream = (msg_chunk, metadata)
        writer(chunk_to_stream)

    return {"joke": joke, "poem": poem}

graph = StateGraph(State).add_node(call_model).add_edge(START, "call_model").compile()

stream_mode="custom"
When streaming LLM tokens without LangChain, we recommend using stream_mode="custom". This allows you to explicitly control which data from the LLM provider APIs to include in LangGraph streamed outputs, including any additional metadata.

async for msg, metadata in graph.astream(
    {"topic": "cats"},
    stream_mode="custom",
):
    print(msg["content"], end="|", flush=True)

How to add dynamic breakpoints with NodeInterrupt¶

Note
For human-in-the-loop workflows use the new interrupt() function for human-in-the-loop workflows. Please review the Human-in-the-loop conceptual guide for more information about design patterns with interrupt.

Prerequisites
This guide assumes familiarity with the following concepts:

Breakpoints
LangGraph Glossary

Human-in-the-loop (HIL) interactions are crucial for agentic systems. Breakpoints are a common HIL interaction pattern, allowing the graph to stop at specific steps and seek human approval before proceeding (e.g., for sensitive actions).
In LangGraph you can add breakpoints before / after a node is executed. But oftentimes it may be helpful to dynamically interrupt the graph from inside a given node based on some condition. When doing so, it may also be helpful to include information about why that interrupt was raised.
This guide shows how you can dynamically interrupt the graph using NodeInterrupt -- a special exception that can be raised from inside a node. Let's see it in action!
Setup¶
First, let's install the required packages
%%capture --no-stderr
%pip install -U langgraph

Set up LangSmith for LangGraph development

        Sign up for LangSmith to quickly spot issues and improve the performance of your LangGraph projects. LangSmith lets you use trace data to debug, test, and monitor your LLM apps built with LangGraph — read more about how to get started here. 
    

Define the graph¶
from typing_extensions import TypedDict
from IPython.display import Image, display

from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END
from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver
from langgraph.errors import NodeInterrupt

class State(TypedDict):
    input: str

def step_1(state: State) -> State:
    print("---Step 1---")
    return state

def step_2(state: State) -> State:
    # Let's optionally raise a NodeInterrupt
    # if the length of the input is longer than 5 characters
    if len(state["input"]) > 5:
        raise NodeInterrupt(
            f"Received input that is longer than 5 characters: {state['input']}"
        )

    print("---Step 2---")
    return state

def step_3(state: State) -> State:
    print("---Step 3---")
    return state

builder = StateGraph(State)
builder.add_node("step_1", step_1)
builder.add_node("step_2", step_2)
builder.add_node("step_3", step_3)
builder.add_edge(START, "step_1")
builder.add_edge("step_1", "step_2")
builder.add_edge("step_2", "step_3")
builder.add_edge("step_3", END)

# Set up memory
memory = MemorySaver()

# Compile the graph with memory
graph = builder.compile(checkpointer=memory)

# View
display(Image(graph.get_graph().draw_mermaid_png()))

API Reference: StateGraph | START | END | MemorySaver

Run the graph with dynamic interrupt¶
First, let's run the graph with an input that <= 5 characters long. This should safely ignore the interrupt condition we defined and return the original input at the end of the graph execution.
initial_input = {"input": "hello"}
thread_config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "1"}}

for event in graph.stream(initial_input, thread_config, stream_mode="values"):
    print(event)

{'input': 'hello'}
---Step 1---
{'input': 'hello'}
---Step 2---
{'input': 'hello'}
---Step 3---
{'input': 'hello'}

If we inspect the graph at this point, we can see that there are no more tasks left to run and that the graph indeed finished execution.
state = graph.get_state(thread_config)
print(state.next)
print(state.tasks)

()
()

Now, let's run the graph with an input that's longer than 5 characters. This should trigger the dynamic interrupt we defined via raising a NodeInterrupt error inside the step_2 node.
initial_input = {"input": "hello world"}
thread_config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "2"}}

# Run the graph until the first interruption
for event in graph.stream(initial_input, thread_config, stream_mode="values"):
    print(event)

{'input': 'hello world'}
---Step 1---
{'input': 'hello world'}

We can see that the graph now stopped while executing step_2. If we inspect the graph state at this point, we can see the information on what node is set to execute next (step_2), as well as what node raised the interrupt (also step_2), and additional information about the interrupt.
state = graph.get_state(thread_config)
print(state.next)
print(state.tasks)

('step_2',)
(PregelTask(id='365d4518-bcff-5abd-8ef5-8a0de7f510b0', name='step_2', error=None, interrupts=(Interrupt(value='Received input that is longer than 5 characters: hello world', when='during'),)),)

If we try to resume the graph from the breakpoint, we will simply interrupt again as our inputs & graph state haven't changed.
# NOTE: to resume the graph from a dynamic interrupt we use the same syntax as with regular interrupts -- we pass None as the input
for event in graph.stream(None, thread_config, stream_mode="values"):
    print(event)

state = graph.get_state(thread_config)
print(state.next)
print(state.tasks)

('step_2',)
(PregelTask(id='365d4518-bcff-5abd-8ef5-8a0de7f510b0', name='step_2', error=None, interrupts=(Interrupt(value='Received input that is longer than 5 characters: hello world', when='during'),)),)

Update the graph state¶
To get around it, we can do several things. 
First, we could simply run the graph on a different thread with a shorter input, like we did in the beginning. Alternatively, if we want to resume the graph execution from the breakpoint, we can update the state to have an input that's shorter than 5 characters (the condition for our interrupt).
# NOTE: this update will be applied as of the last successful node before the interrupt, i.e. `step_1`, right before the node with an interrupt
graph.update_state(config=thread_config, values={"input": "foo"})
for event in graph.stream(None, thread_config, stream_mode="values"):
    print(event)

state = graph.get_state(thread_config)
print(state.next)
print(state.values)

---Step 2---
{'input': 'foo'}
---Step 3---
{'input': 'foo'}
()
{'input': 'foo'}

You can also update the state as node step_2 (interrupted node) which would skip over that node altogether
initial_input = {"input": "hello world"}
thread_config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "3"}}

# Run the graph until the first interruption
for event in graph.stream(initial_input, thread_config, stream_mode="values"):
    print(event)

{'input': 'hello world'}
---Step 1---
{'input': 'hello world'}

# NOTE: this update will skip the node `step_2` altogether
graph.update_state(config=thread_config, values=None, as_node="step_2")
for event in graph.stream(None, thread_config, stream_mode="values"):
    print(event)

state = graph.get_state(thread_config)
print(state.next)
print(state.values)

---Step 3---
{'input': 'hello world'}
()
{'input': 'hello world'}

How to add breakpoints¶

Prerequisites
This guide assumes familiarity with the following concepts:

Breakpoints
LangGraph Glossary

Human-in-the-loop (HIL) interactions are crucial for agentic systems. Breakpoints are a common HIL interaction pattern, allowing the graph to stop at specific steps and seek human approval before proceeding (e.g., for sensitive actions). 
Breakpoints are built on top of LangGraph checkpoints, which save the graph's state after each node execution. Checkpoints are saved in threads that preserve graph state and can be accessed after a graph has finished execution. This allows for graph execution to pause at specific points, await human approval, and then resume execution from the last checkpoint.

Setup¶
First we need to install the packages required
%%capture --no-stderr
%pip install --quiet -U langgraph langchain_anthropic

Next, we need to set API keys for Anthropic (the LLM we will use)
import getpass
import os

def _set_env(var: str):
    if not os.environ.get(var):
        os.environ[var] = getpass.getpass(f"{var}: ")

_set_env("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY")

Set up LangSmith for LangGraph development

        Sign up for LangSmith to quickly spot issues and improve the performance of your LangGraph projects. LangSmith lets you use trace data to debug, test, and monitor your LLM apps built with LangGraph — read more about how to get started here. 
    

Simple Usage¶
Let's look at very basic usage of this.
Below, we do two things:
1) We specify the breakpoint using interrupt_before the specified step.
2) We set up a checkpointer to save the state of the graph.
from typing_extensions import TypedDict
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END
from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver
from IPython.display import Image, display

class State(TypedDict):
    input: str

def step_1(state):
    print("---Step 1---")
    pass

def step_2(state):
    print("---Step 2---")
    pass

def step_3(state):
    print("---Step 3---")
    pass

builder = StateGraph(State)
builder.add_node("step_1", step_1)
builder.add_node("step_2", step_2)
builder.add_node("step_3", step_3)
builder.add_edge(START, "step_1")
builder.add_edge("step_1", "step_2")
builder.add_edge("step_2", "step_3")
builder.add_edge("step_3", END)

# Set up memory
memory = MemorySaver()

# Add
graph = builder.compile(checkpointer=memory, interrupt_before=["step_3"])

# View
display(Image(graph.get_graph().draw_mermaid_png()))

API Reference: StateGraph | START | END | MemorySaver

We create a thread ID for the checkpointer.
We run until step 3, as defined with interrupt_before. 
After the user input / approval, we resume execution by invoking the graph with None. 
# Input
initial_input = {"input": "hello world"}

# Thread
thread = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "1"}}

# Run the graph until the first interruption
for event in graph.stream(initial_input, thread, stream_mode="values"):
    print(event)

try:
    user_approval = input("Do you want to go to Step 3? (yes/no): ")
except:
    user_approval = "yes"

if user_approval.lower() == "yes":
    # If approved, continue the graph execution
    for event in graph.stream(None, thread, stream_mode="values"):
        print(event)
else:
    print("Operation cancelled by user.")

{'input': 'hello world'}
---Step 1---
---Step 2---
``````output
Do you want to go to Step 3? (yes/no):  yes
``````output
---Step 3---

Agent¶
In the context of agents, breakpoints are useful to manually approve certain agent actions.
To show this, we will build a relatively simple ReAct-style agent that does tool calling. 
We'll add a breakpoint before the action node is called. 
# Set up the tool
from langchain_anthropic import ChatAnthropic
from langchain_core.tools import tool
from langgraph.graph import MessagesState, START
from langgraph.prebuilt import ToolNode
from langgraph.graph import END, StateGraph
from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver

@tool
def search(query: str):
    """Call to surf the web."""
    # This is a placeholder for the actual implementation
    # Don't let the LLM know this though 😊
    return [
        "It's sunny in San Francisco, but you better look out if you're a Gemini 😈."
    ]

tools = [search]
tool_node = ToolNode(tools)

# Set up the model

model = ChatAnthropic(model="claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620")
model = model.bind_tools(tools)

# Define nodes and conditional edges

# Define the function that determines whether to continue or not
def should_continue(state):
    messages = state["messages"]
    last_message = messages[-1]
    # If there is no function call, then we finish
    if not last_message.tool_calls:
        return "end"
    # Otherwise if there is, we continue
    else:
        return "continue"

# Define the function that calls the model
def call_model(state):
    messages = state["messages"]
    response = model.invoke(messages)
    # We return a list, because this will get added to the existing list
    return {"messages": [response]}

# Define a new graph
workflow = StateGraph(MessagesState)

# Define the two nodes we will cycle between
workflow.add_node("agent", call_model)
workflow.add_node("action", tool_node)

# Set the entrypoint as `agent`
# This means that this node is the first one called
workflow.add_edge(START, "agent")

# We now add a conditional edge
workflow.add_conditional_edges(
    # First, we define the start node. We use `agent`.
    # This means these are the edges taken after the `agent` node is called.
    "agent",

# We now add a normal edge from `tools` to `agent`.

workflow.add_edge("action", "agent")

# Set up memory
memory = MemorySaver()

# Finally, we compile it!
# This compiles it into a LangChain Runnable,
# meaning you can use it as you would any other runnable

# We add in `interrupt_before=["action"]`
# This will add a breakpoint before the `action` node is called
app = workflow.compile(checkpointer=memory, interrupt_before=["action"])

display(Image(app.get_graph().draw_mermaid_png()))

Interacting with the Agent¶
We can now interact with the agent.
We see that it stops before calling a tool, because interrupt_before is set before the action node.
from langchain_core.messages import HumanMessage

thread = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "3"}}
inputs = [HumanMessage(content="search for the weather in sf now")]
for event in app.stream({"messages": inputs}, thread, stream_mode="values"):
    event["messages"][-1].pretty_print()

API Reference: HumanMessage
================================[1m Human Message [0m=================================

search for the weather in sf now

Resume
We can now call the agent again with no inputs to continue.
This will run the tool as requested.
Running an interrupted graph with None in the inputs means to proceed as if the interruption didn't occur.
for event in app.stream(None, thread, stream_mode="values"):
    event["messages"][-1].pretty_print()

["It's sunny in San Francisco, but you better look out if you're a Gemini \ud83d\ude08."]
==================================[1m Ai Message [0m==================================

Based on the search results, I can provide you with information about the current weather in San Francisco:

The weather in San Francisco right now is sunny. 

It's worth noting that the search result includes a playful reference to astrology, suggesting that Geminis should "look out." However, this is likely just a humorous addition and not related to the actual weather conditions.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about the weather in San Francisco or any other location?

How to view and update past graph state¶

Prerequisites
This guide assumes familiarity with the following concepts:

Time Travel
Breakpoints
LangGraph Glossary

Once you start checkpointing your graphs, you can easily get or update the state of the agent at any point in time. This permits a few things:

You can surface a state during an interrupt to a user to let them accept an action.
You can rewind the graph to reproduce or avoid issues.
You can modify the state to embed your agent into a larger system, or to let the user better control its actions.

The key methods used for this functionality are:

get_state: fetch the values from the target config
update_state: apply the given values to the target state

Note: this requires passing in a checkpointer.
Below is a quick example.
Setup¶
First we need to install the packages required
%%capture --no-stderr
%pip install --quiet -U langgraph langchain_openai

Next, we need to set API keys for OpenAI (the LLM we will use)
import getpass
import os

def _set_env(var: str):
    if not os.environ.get(var):
        os.environ[var] = getpass.getpass(f"{var}: ")

_set_env("OPENAI_API_KEY")

ANTHROPIC_API_KEY:  ········

Build the agent¶
We can now build the agent. We will build a relatively simple ReAct-style agent that does tool calling. We will use Anthropic's models and fake tools (just for demo purposes).
# Set up the tool
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from langchain_core.tools import tool
from langgraph.graph import MessagesState, START
from langgraph.prebuilt import ToolNode
from langgraph.graph import END, StateGraph
from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver

@tool
def play_song_on_spotify(song: str):
    """Play a song on Spotify"""
    # Call the spotify API ...
    return f"Successfully played {song} on Spotify!"

@tool
def play_song_on_apple(song: str):
    """Play a song on Apple Music"""
    # Call the apple music API ...
    return f"Successfully played {song} on Apple Music!"

tools = [play_song_on_apple, play_song_on_spotify]
tool_node = ToolNode(tools)

# Set up the model

model = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o-mini")
model = model.bind_tools(tools, parallel_tool_calls=False)

# Define nodes and conditional edges

# Define the function that determines whether to continue or not
def should_continue(state):
    messages = state["messages"]
    last_message = messages[-1]
    # If there is no function call, then we finish
    if not last_message.tool_calls:
        return "end"
    # Otherwise if there is, we continue
    else:
        return "continue"

# Define the function that calls the model
def call_model(state):
    messages = state["messages"]
    response = model.invoke(messages)
    # We return a list, because this will get added to the existing list
    return {"messages": [response]}

# Define a new graph
workflow = StateGraph(MessagesState)

# Define the two nodes we will cycle between
workflow.add_node("agent", call_model)
workflow.add_node("action", tool_node)

# Set the entrypoint as `agent`
# This means that this node is the first one called
workflow.add_edge(START, "agent")

# We now add a conditional edge
workflow.add_conditional_edges(
    # First, we define the start node. We use `agent`.
    # This means these are the edges taken after the `agent` node is called.
    "agent",
    # Next, we pass in the function that will determine which node is called next.
    should_continue,
    # Finally we pass in a mapping.
    # The keys are strings, and the values are other nodes.
    # END is a special node marking that the graph should finish.
    # What will happen is we will call `should_continue`, and then the output of that
    # will be matched against the keys in this mapping.
    # Based on which one it matches, that node will then be called.
    {
        # If `tools`, then we call the tool node.
        "continue": "action",
        # Otherwise we finish.
        "end": END,
    },
)

# We now add a normal edge from `tools` to `agent`.
# This means that after `tools` is called, `agent` node is called next.
workflow.add_edge("action", "agent")

# Set up memory
memory = MemorySaver()

# Finally, we compile it!
# This compiles it into a LangChain Runnable,
# meaning you can use it as you would any other runnable

# We add in `interrupt_before=["action"]`
# This will add a breakpoint before the `action` node is called
app = workflow.compile(checkpointer=memory)

API Reference: ChatOpenAI | tool | START | ToolNode | END | StateGraph | MemorySaver
Interacting with the Agent¶
We can now interact with the agent. Let's ask it to play Taylor Swift's most popular song:
from langchain_core.messages import HumanMessage

config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "1"}}
input_message = HumanMessage(content="Can you play Taylor Swift's most popular song?")
for event in app.stream({"messages": [input_message]}, config, stream_mode="values"):
    event["messages"][-1].pretty_print()

Replay a state¶
We can go back to any of these states and restart the agent from there! Let's go back to right before the tool call gets executed.
to_replay = all_states[2]

to_replay.values

{'messages': [HumanMessage(content="Can you play Taylor Swift's most popular song?", id='7e32f0f3-75f5-48e1-a4ae-d38ccc15973b'),
  AIMessage(content='', additional_kwargs={'tool_calls': [{'id': 'call_uhGY6Fv6Mr4ZOhSokintuoD7', 'function': {'arguments': '{"song":"Anti-Hero by Taylor Swift"}', 'name': 'play_song_on_apple'}, 'type': 'function'}], 'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 22, 'prompt_tokens': 80, 'total_tokens': 102}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_483d39d857', 'finish_reason': 'tool_calls', 'logprobs': None}, id='run-af077bc4-f03c-4afe-8d92-78bdae394412-0', tool_calls=[{'name': 'play_song_on_apple', 'args': {'song': 'Anti-Hero by Taylor Swift'}, 'id': 'call_uhGY6Fv6Mr4ZOhSokintuoD7', 'type': 'tool_call'}], usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 80, 'output_tokens': 22, 'total_tokens': 102})]}

to_replay.next

('action',)

To replay from this place we just need to pass its config back to the agent. Notice that it just resumes from right where it left all - making a tool call.
for event in app.stream(None, to_replay.config):
    for v in event.values():
        print(v)

{'messages': [ToolMessage(content='Succesfully played Anti-Hero by Taylor Swift on Apple Music!', name='play_song_on_apple', tool_call_id='call_uhGY6Fv6Mr4ZOhSokintuoD7')]}
{'messages': [AIMessage(content='I\'ve started playing "Anti-Hero" by Taylor Swift on Apple Music! Enjoy the music!', additional_kwargs={'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 20, 'prompt_tokens': 126, 'total_tokens': 146}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_483d39d857', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, id='run-dc338bbd-d623-40bb-b824-5d2307954b57-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 126, 'output_tokens': 20, 'total_tokens': 146})]}

Branch off a past state¶
Using LangGraph's checkpointing, you can do more than just replay past states. You can branch off previous locations to let the agent explore alternate trajectories or to let a user "version control" changes in a workflow.
Let's show how to do this to edit the state at a particular point in time. Let's update the state to instead of playing the song on Apple to play it on Spotify:
# Let's now get the last message in the state
# This is the one with the tool calls that we want to update
last_message = to_replay.values["messages"][-1]

# Let's now update the tool we are calling
last_message.tool_calls[0]["name"] = "play_song_on_spotify"

branch_config = app.update_state(
    to_replay.config,
    {"messages": [last_message]},
)

We can then invoke with this new branch_config to resume running from here with changed state. We can see from the log that the tool was called with different input.
for event in app.stream(None, branch_config):
    for v in event.values():
        print(v)

{'messages': [ToolMessage(content='Succesfully played Anti-Hero by Taylor Swift on Spotify!', name='play_song_on_spotify', tool_call_id='call_uhGY6Fv6Mr4ZOhSokintuoD7')]}
{'messages': [AIMessage(content='I\'ve started playing "Anti-Hero" by Taylor Swift on Spotify. Enjoy the music!', additional_kwargs={'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 19, 'prompt_tokens': 125, 'total_tokens': 144}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_483d39d857', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, id='run-7d8d5094-7029-4da3-9e0e-ef9d18b63615-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 125, 'output_tokens': 19, 'total_tokens': 144})]}

Alternatively, we could update the state to not even call a tool!
from langchain_core.messages import AIMessage

# Let's now get the last message in the state
# This is the one with the tool calls that we want to update
last_message = to_replay.values["messages"][-1]

# Let's now get the ID for the last message, and create a new message with that ID.
new_message = AIMessage(
    content="It's quiet hours so I can't play any music right now!", id=last_message.id
)

branch_config = app.update_state(
    to_replay.config,
    {"messages": [new_message]},
)

API Reference: AIMessage
branch_state = app.get_state(branch_config)

branch_state.values

{'messages': [HumanMessage(content="Can you play Taylor Swift's most popular song?", id='7e32f0f3-75f5-48e1-a4ae-d38ccc15973b'),
  AIMessage(content="It's quiet hours so I can't play any music right now!", id='run-af077bc4-f03c-4afe-8d92-78bdae394412-0')]}

branch_state.next

()

You can see the snapshot was updated and now correctly reflects that there is no next step.

How to edit graph state¶

Prerequisites

Human-in-the-loop
Breakpoints
LangGraph Glossary

Human-in-the-loop (HIL) interactions are crucial for agentic systems. Manually updating the graph state a common HIL interaction pattern, allowing the human to edit actions (e.g., what tool is being called or how it is being called).
We can implement this in LangGraph using a breakpoint: breakpoints allow us to interrupt graph execution before a specific step. At this breakpoint, we can manually update the graph state and then resume from that spot to continue.  

Setup¶
First we need to install the packages required
%%capture --no-stderr
%pip install --quiet -U langgraph langchain_anthropic

Next, we need to set API keys for Anthropic (the LLM we will use)
import getpass
import os

def _set_env(var: str):
    if not os.environ.get(var):
        os.environ[var] = getpass.getpass(f"{var}: ")

_set_env("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY")

ANTHROPIC_API_KEY:  ········

        Sign up for LangSmith to quickly spot issues and improve the performance of your LangGraph projects. LangSmith lets you use trace data to debug, test, and monitor your LLM apps built with LangGraph — read more about how to get started here. 
    

Simple Usage¶
Let's look at very basic usage of this.
Below, we do three things:
1) We specify the breakpoint using interrupt_before a specified step (node).
2) We set up a checkpointer to save the state of the graph up until this node.
3) We use .update_state to update the state of the graph.
from typing_extensions import TypedDict
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END
from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver
from IPython.display import Image, display

class State(TypedDict):
    input: str

def step_1(state):
    print("---Step 1---")
    pass

def step_2(state):
    print("---Step 2---")
    pass

def step_3(state):
    print("---Step 3---")
    pass

builder = StateGraph(State)
builder.add_node("step_1", step_1)
builder.add_node("step_2", step_2)
builder.add_node("step_3", step_3)
builder.add_edge(START, "step_1")
builder.add_edge("step_1", "step_2")
builder.add_edge("step_2", "step_3")
builder.add_edge("step_3", END)

# Set up memory
memory = MemorySaver()

# Add
graph = builder.compile(checkpointer=memory, interrupt_before=["step_2"])

# View
display(Image(graph.get_graph().draw_mermaid_png()))

API Reference: StateGraph | START | END | MemorySaver

# Input
initial_input = {"input": "hello world"}

# Thread
thread = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "1"}}

# Run the graph until the first interruption
for event in graph.stream(initial_input, thread, stream_mode="values"):
    print(event)

{'input': 'hello world'}
---Step 1---

Now, we can just manually update our graph state - 
print("Current state!")
print(graph.get_state(thread).values)

graph.update_state(thread, {"input": "hello universe!"})

print("---\n---\nUpdated state!")
print(graph.get_state(thread).values)

Current state!
{'input': 'hello world'}
---
---
Updated state!
{'input': 'hello universe!'}

# Continue the graph execution
for event in graph.stream(None, thread, stream_mode="values"):
    print(event)

---Step 2---
---Step 3---

Agent¶
In the context of agents, updating state is useful for things like editing tool calls.
To show this, we will build a relatively simple ReAct-style agent that does tool calling. 
We will use Anthropic's models and a fake tool (just for demo purposes).
# Set up the tool
from langchain_anthropic import ChatAnthropic
from langchain_core.tools import tool
from langgraph.graph import MessagesState, START, END, StateGraph
from langgraph.prebuilt import ToolNode
from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver

@tool
def search(query: str):
    """Call to surf the web."""
    # This is a placeholder for the actual implementation
    # Don't let the LLM know this though 😊
    return [
        "It's sunny in San Francisco, but you better look out if you're a Gemini 😈."
    ]

tools = [search]
tool_node = ToolNode(tools)

# Set up the model

model = ChatAnthropic(model="claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620")
model = model.bind_tools(tools)

# Define nodes and conditional edges

# Define the function that determines whether to continue or not
def should_continue(state):
    messages = state["messages"]
    last_message = messages[-1]
    # If there is no function call, then we finish
    if not last_message.tool_calls:
        return "end"
    # Otherwise if there is, we continue
    else:
        return "continue"

# Define the function that calls the model
def call_model(state):
    messages = state["messages"]
    response = model.invoke(messages)
    # We return a list, because this will get added to the existing list
    return {"messages": [response]}

# Define a new graph
workflow = StateGraph(MessagesState)

# Define the two nodes we will cycle between
workflow.add_node("agent", call_model)
workflow.add_node("action", tool_node)

# Set the entrypoint as `agent`
# This means that this node is the first one called
workflow.add_edge(START, "agent")

# We now add a conditional edge
workflow.add_conditional_edges(
    # First, we define the start node. We use `agent`.
    # This means these are the edges taken after the `agent` node is called.
    "agent",
    # Next, we pass in the function that will determine which node is called next.
    should_continue,
    # Finally we pass in a mapping.
    # The keys are strings, and the values are other nodes.
    # END is a special node marking that the graph should finish.
    # What will happen is we will call `should_continue`, and then the output of that
    # will be matched against the keys in this mapping.
    # Based on which one it matches, that node will then be called.
    {
        # If `tools`, then we call the tool node.
        "continue": "action",
        # Otherwise we finish.
        "end": END,
    },
)

# We now add a normal edge from `tools` to `agent`.
# This means that after `tools` is called, `agent` node is called next.
workflow.add_edge("action", "agent")

# Set up memory
memory = MemorySaver()

# Finally, we compile it!
# This compiles it into a LangChain Runnable,
# meaning you can use it as you would any other runnable

# We add in `interrupt_before=["action"]`
# This will add a breakpoint before the `action` node is called
app = workflow.compile(checkpointer=memory, interrupt_before=["action"])

API Reference: ChatAnthropic | tool | START | END | StateGraph | ToolNode | MemorySaver
Interacting with the Agent¶
We can now interact with the agent and see that it stops before calling a tool.
from langchain_core.messages import HumanMessage

thread = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "3"}}
inputs = [HumanMessage(content="search for the weather in sf now")]
for event in app.stream({"messages": inputs}, thread, stream_mode="values"):
    event["messages"][-1].pretty_print()

API Reference: HumanMessage
================================[1m Human Message [0m=================================

search for the weather in sf now
==================================[1m Ai Message [0m==================================

[{'text': "Certainly! I'll search for the current weather in San Francisco for you. Let me use the search function to find this information.", 'type': 'text'}, {'id': 'toolu_01DxRhkj4fAvaGWoBhVuvfeL', 'input': {'query': 'current weather in San Francisco'}, 'name': 'search', 'type': 'tool_use'}]
Tool Calls:
  search (toolu_01DxRhkj4fAvaGWoBhVuvfeL)
 Call ID: toolu_01DxRhkj4fAvaGWoBhVuvfeL
  Args:
    query: current weather in San Francisco

Edit
We can now update the state accordingly. Let's modify the tool call to have the query "current weather in SF".
# First, lets get the current state
current_state = app.get_state(thread)

# Let's now get the last message in the state
# This is the one with the tool calls that we want to update
last_message = current_state.values["messages"][-1]

# Let's now update the args for that tool call
last_message.tool_calls[0]["args"] = {"query": "current weather in SF"}

# Let's now call `update_state` to pass in this message in the `messages` key
# This will get treated as any other update to the state
# It will get passed to the reducer function for the `messages` key
# That reducer function will use the ID of the message to update it
# It's important that it has the right ID! Otherwise it would get appended
# as a new message
app.update_state(thread, {"messages": last_message})

{'configurable': {'thread_id': '3',
  'checkpoint_ns': '',
  'checkpoint_id': '1ef7830a-c688-6fc6-8002-824126081ba0'}}

Let's now check the current state of the app to make sure it got updated accordingly
current_state = app.get_state(thread).values["messages"][-1].tool_calls
current_state

[{'name': 'search',
  'args': {'query': 'current weather in SF'},
  'id': 'toolu_01FSkinAVXR1C4D5kecrzAnj'}]

Resume
We can now call the agent again with no inputs to continue, ie. run the tool as requested. We can see from the logs that it passes in the update args to the tool.
for event in app.stream(None, thread, stream_mode="values"):
    event["messages"][-1].pretty_print()

=================================[1m Tool Message [0m=================================
Name: search

["It's sunny in San Francisco, but you better look out if you're a Gemini \ud83d\ude08."]
==================================[1m Ai Message [0m==================================

Based on the search results, I can provide you with the current weather information for San Francisco:

The weather in San Francisco is currently sunny. 

It's important to note that the search result also included a playful astrological reference, which isn't directly related to the weather. If you need more specific weather details like temperature, humidity, or forecast, please let me know, and I can perform another search to find that information for you.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about the weather in San Francisco or any other location?

How to wait for user input using interrupt¶

Prerequisites
This guide assumes familiarity with the following concepts:

Human-in-the-loop
Breakpoints
LangGraph Glossary

Human-in-the-loop (HIL) interactions are crucial for agentic systems. Waiting for human input is a common HIL interaction pattern, allowing the agent to ask the user clarifying questions and await input before proceeding. 
We can implement this in LangGraph using the interrupt() function. interrupt allows us to stop graph execution to collect input from a user and continue execution with collected input.
Setup¶
First we need to install the packages required
%%capture --no-stderr
%pip install --quiet -U langgraph langchain_anthropic

Next, we need to set API keys for Anthropic and / or OpenAI (the LLM(s) we will use)
import getpass

def _set_env(var: str):
    if not os.environ.get(var):
        os.environ[var] = getpass.getpass(f"{var}: ")

Set up LangSmith for LangGraph development

        Sign up for LangSmith to quickly spot issues and improve the performance of your LangGraph projects. LangSmith lets you use trace data to debug, test, and monitor your LLM apps built with LangGraph — read more about how to get started here. 
    

Simple Usage¶
Let's explore a basic example of using human feedback. A straightforward approach is to create a node, human_feedback, designed specifically to collect user input. This allows us to gather feedback at a specific, chosen point in our graph.
Steps:

Call interrupt() inside the human_feedback node.  
Set up a checkpointer to save the graph's state up to this node.  
Use Command(resume=...) to provide the requested value to the human_feedback node and resume execution.

from typing_extensions import TypedDict
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END
from langgraph.types import Command, interrupt
from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver
from IPython.display import Image, display

class State(TypedDict):
    input: str
    user_feedback: str

def step_1(state):
    print("---Step 1---")
    pass

def human_feedback(state):
    print("---human_feedback---")
    feedback = interrupt("Please provide feedback:")
    return {"user_feedback": feedback}

def step_3(state):
    print("---Step 3---")
    pass

builder = StateGraph(State)
builder.add_node("step_1", step_1)
builder.add_node("human_feedback", human_feedback)
builder.add_node("step_3", step_3)
builder.add_edge(START, "step_1")
builder.add_edge("step_1", "human_feedback")
builder.add_edge("human_feedback", "step_3")
builder.add_edge("step_3", END)

# Set up memory
memory = MemorySaver()

# Add
graph = builder.compile(checkpointer=memory)

# View
display(Image(graph.get_graph().draw_mermaid_png()))

API Reference: StateGraph | START | END | Command | interrupt | MemorySaver

Run until our breakpoint at human_feedback:
# Input
initial_input = {"input": "hello world"}

# Thread
thread = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "1"}}

# Run the graph until the first interruption
for event in graph.stream(initial_input, thread, stream_mode="updates"):
    print(event)
    print("\n")

---Step 1---
{'step_1': None}

---human_feedback---
{'__interrupt__': (Interrupt(value='Please provide feedback:', resumable=True, ns=['human_feedback:e9a51d27-22ed-8c01-3f17-0ed33209b554'], when='during'),)}

Now, we can manually update our graph state with the user input:
# Continue the graph execution
for event in graph.stream(
    Command(resume="go to step 3!"), thread, stream_mode="updates"
):
    print(event)
    print("\n")

---human_feedback---
{'human_feedback': {'user_feedback': 'go to step 3!'}}

---Step 3---
{'step_3': None}

We can see our feedback was added to state - 
graph.get_state(thread).values

{'input': 'hello world', 'user_feedback': 'go to step 3!'}

Agent¶
In the context of agents, waiting for user feedback is especially useful for asking clarifying questions. To illustrate this, we’ll create a simple ReAct-style agent capable of tool calling. 
For this example, we’ll use Anthropic's chat model along with a mock tool (purely for demonstration purposes).

Using Pydantic with LangChain

        This notebook uses Pydantic v2 BaseModel, which requires langchain-core >= 0.3. Using langchain-core < 0.3 will result in errors due to mixing of Pydantic v1 and v2 BaseModels.
    

# Set up the state
from langgraph.graph import MessagesState, START

# Set up the tool
# We will have one real tool - a search tool
# We'll also have one "fake" tool - a "ask_human" tool
# Here we define any ACTUAL tools
from langchain_core.tools import tool
from langgraph.prebuilt import ToolNode

@tool
def search(query: str):
    """Call to surf the web."""
    # This is a placeholder for the actual implementation
    # Don't let the LLM know this though 😊
    return f"I looked up: {query}. Result: It's sunny in San Francisco, but you better look out if you're a Gemini 😈."

tools = [search]
tool_node = ToolNode(tools)

# Set up the model
from langchain_anthropic import ChatAnthropic

model = ChatAnthropic(model="claude-3-5-sonnet-latest")

from pydantic import BaseModel

# We are going "bind" all tools to the model
# We have the ACTUAL tools from above, but we also need a mock tool to ask a human
# Since `bind_tools` takes in tools but also just tool definitions,
# We can define a tool definition for `ask_human`
class AskHuman(BaseModel):
    """Ask the human a question"""

    question: str

model = model.bind_tools(tools + [AskHuman])

# Define nodes and conditional edges

# Define the function that determines whether to continue or not
def should_continue(state):
    messages = state["messages"]
    last_message = messages[-1]
    # If there is no function call, then we finish
    if not last_message.tool_calls:
        return END
    # If tool call is asking Human, we return that node
    # You could also add logic here to let some system know that there's something that requires Human input
    # For example, send a slack message, etc
    elif last_message.tool_calls[0]["name"] == "AskHuman":
        return "ask_human"
    # Otherwise if there is, we continue
    else:
        return "action"

# Define the function that calls the model
def call_model(state):
    messages = state["messages"]
    response = model.invoke(messages)
    # We return a list, because this will get added to the existing list
    return {"messages": [response]}

# We define a fake node to ask the human
def ask_human(state):
    tool_call_id = state["messages"][-1].tool_calls[0]["id"]
    ask = AskHuman.model_validate(state["messages"][-1].tool_calls[0]["args"])
    location = interrupt(ask.question)
    tool_message = [{"tool_call_id": tool_call_id, "type": "tool", "content": location}]
    return {"messages": tool_message}

# Build the graph

from langgraph.graph import END, StateGraph

# Define a new graph
workflow = StateGraph(MessagesState)

# Define the three nodes we will cycle between
workflow.add_node("agent", call_model)
workflow.add_node("action", tool_node)
workflow.add_node("ask_human", ask_human)

# Set the entrypoint as `agent`
# This means that this node is the first one called
workflow.add_edge(START, "agent")

# We now add a conditional edge
workflow.add_conditional_edges(
    # First, we define the start node. We use `agent`.
    # This means these are the edges taken after the `agent` node is called.
    "agent",
    # Next, we pass in the function that will determine which node is called next.
    should_continue,
)

# We now add a normal edge from `tools` to `agent`.
# This means that after `tools` is called, `agent` node is called next.
workflow.add_edge("action", "agent")

# After we get back the human response, we go back to the agent
workflow.add_edge("ask_human", "agent")

# Set up memory
from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver

memory = MemorySaver()

# Finally, we compile it!
# This compiles it into a LangChain Runnable,
# meaning you can use it as you would any other runnable
# We add a breakpoint BEFORE the `ask_human` node so it never executes
app = workflow.compile(checkpointer=memory)

display(Image(app.get_graph().draw_mermaid_png()))

API Reference: START | tool | ToolNode | ChatAnthropic | END | StateGraph | MemorySaver

Interacting with the Agent¶
We can now interact with the agent. Let's ask it to ask the user where they are, then tell them the weather. 
This should make it use the ask_human tool first, then use the normal tool.
config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "2"}}
for event in app.stream(
    {
        "messages": [
            (
                "user",
                "Ask the user where they are, then look up the weather there",
            )
        ]
    },
    config,
    stream_mode="values",
):
    event["messages"][-1].pretty_print()

================================[1m Human Message [0m=================================

Use the search tool to ask the user where they are, then look up the weather there

Tool Calls:
  AskHuman (toolu_01KNvb7RCVu8yKYUuQQSKN1x)
 Call ID: toolu_01KNvb7RCVu8yKYUuQQSKN1x
  Args:
    question: Where are you located?

app.get_state(config).next

('ask_human',)

You can see that our graph got interrupted inside the ask_human node, which is now waiting for a location to be provided. We can provide this value by invoking the graph with a Command(resume="<location>") input:
for event in app.stream(Command(resume="san francisco"), config, stream_mode="values"):
    event["messages"][-1].pretty_print()

==================================[1m Ai Message [0m==================================

How to Review Tool Calls¶

Prerequisites
This guide assumes familiarity with the following concepts:

Tool calling
Human-in-the-loop
LangGraph Glossary 

Human-in-the-loop (HIL) interactions are crucial for agentic systems. A common pattern is to add some human in the loop step after certain tool calls. These tool calls often lead to either a function call or saving of some information. Examples include:

A tool call to execute SQL, which will then be run by the tool
A tool call to generate a summary, which will then be saved to the State of the graph

Note that using tool calls is common whether actually calling tools or not.
There are typically a few different interactions you may want to do here:

Approve the tool call and continue
Modify the tool call manually and then continue
Give natural language feedback, and then pass that back to the agent

We can implement these in LangGraph using the interrupt() function. interrupt allows us to stop graph execution to collect input from a user and continue execution with collected input:
def human_review_node(state) -> Command[Literal["call_llm", "run_tool"]]:
    # this is the value we'll be providing via Command(resume=<human_review>)
    human_review = interrupt(
        {
            "question": "Is this correct?",
            # Surface tool calls for review
            "tool_call": tool_call
        }
    )

    review_action, review_data = human_review

    # Approve the tool call and continue
    if review_action == "continue":
        return Command(goto="run_tool")

    # Modify the tool call manually and then continue
    elif review_action == "update":
        ...
        updated_msg = get_updated_msg(review_data)
        return Command(goto="run_tool", update={"messages": [updated_message]})

    # Give natural language feedback, and then pass that back to the agent
    elif review_action == "feedback":
        ...
        feedback_msg = get_feedback_msg(review_data)
        return Command(goto="call_llm", update={"messages": [feedback_msg]})

Setup¶
First we need to install the packages required
%%capture --no-stderr
%pip install --quiet -U langgraph langchain_anthropic

Next, we need to set API keys for Anthropic (the LLM we will use)
import getpass
import os

def _set_env(var: str):
    if not os.environ.get(var):
        os.environ[var] = getpass.getpass(f"{var}: ")

_set_env("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY")

ANTHROPIC_API_KEY:  ········

Simple Usage¶
Let's set up a very simple graph that facilitates this.
First, we will have an LLM call that decides what action to take.
Then we go to a human node. This node actually doesn't do anything - the idea is that we interrupt before this node and then apply any updates to the state.
After that, we check the state and either route back to the LLM or to the correct tool.
Let's see this in action!

Example with no review¶
Let's look at an example when no review is required (because no tools are called)
# Input
initial_input = {"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "hi!"}]}

# Thread
thread = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "1"}}

# Run the graph until the first interruption
for event in graph.stream(initial_input, thread, stream_mode="updates"):
    print(event)
    print("\n")

{'call_llm': {'messages': [AIMessage(content="Hello! I'm here to help you. I can assist you with checking the weather in different cities using the weather search tool. Would you like to know the weather for a specific city? Just let me know which city you're interested in!", additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={'id': 'msg_01XHvA3ZWpsq4PdyiruWFLBs', 'model': 'claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022', 'stop_reason': 'end_turn', 'stop_sequence': None, 'usage': {'input_tokens': 374, 'output_tokens': 52}}, id='run-c3ff5fea-0135-4d66-8ec1-f8ed6a88356b-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 374, 'output_tokens': 52, 'total_tokens': 426, 'input_token_details': {}})]}}

If we check the state, we can see that it is finished
Example of approving tool¶
Let's now look at what it looks like to approve a tool call
# Input
initial_input = {"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "what's the weather in sf?"}]}

# Thread
thread = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "2"}}

# Run the graph until the first interruption
for event in graph.stream(initial_input, thread, stream_mode="updates"):
    print(event)
    print("\n")

{'call_llm': {'messages': [AIMessage(content=[{'text': "I'll help you check the weather in San Francisco.", 'type': 'text'}, {'id': 'toolu_01Kn67GmQAA3BEF1cfYdNW3c', 'input': {'city': 'sf'}, 'name': 'weather_search', 'type': 'tool_use'}], additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={'id': 'msg_013eJXUAEA2ANvYLkDUQFRPo', 'model': 'claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022', 'stop_reason': 'tool_use', 'stop_sequence': None, 'usage': {'input_tokens': 379, 'output_tokens': 65}}, id='run-e8174b94-f681-4688-967f-a32295412f91-0', tool_calls=[{'name': 'weather_search', 'args': {'city': 'sf'}, 'id': 'toolu_01Kn67GmQAA3BEF1cfYdNW3c', 'type': 'tool_call'}], usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 379, 'output_tokens': 65, 'total_tokens': 444, 'input_token_details': {}})]}}

{'__interrupt__': (Interrupt(value={'question': 'Is this correct?', 'tool_call': {'name': 'weather_search', 'args': {'city': 'sf'}, 'id': 'toolu_01Kn67GmQAA3BEF1cfYdNW3c', 'type': 'tool_call'}}, resumable=True, ns=['human_review_node:be252162-5b29-0a98-1ed2-c807c1fc64c6'], when='during'),)}

If we now check, we can see that it is waiting on human review
print("Pending Executions!")
print(graph.get_state(thread).next)

Pending Executions!
('human_review_node',)

To approve the tool call, we can just continue the thread with no edits. To do so, we need to let human_review_node know what value to use for the human_review variable we defined inside the node. We can provide this value by invoking the graph with a Command(resume=<human_review>) input.  Since we're approving the tool call, we'll provide resume value of {"action": "continue"} to navigate to run_tool node:
for event in graph.stream(
    # provide value
    Command(resume={"action": "continue"}),
    thread,
    stream_mode="updates",
):
    print(event)
    print("\n")

{'human_review_node': None}

{'run_tool': {'messages': [{'role': 'tool', 'name': 'weather_search', 'content': 'Sunny!', 'tool_call_id': 'toolu_01Kn67GmQAA3BEF1cfYdNW3c'}]}}

{'call_llm': {'messages': [AIMessage(content="According to the search, it's sunny in San Francisco today!", additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={'id': 'msg_01FJTbC8oK5fkD73rUBmAtUx', 'model': 'claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022', 'stop_reason': 'end_turn', 'stop_sequence': None, 'usage': {'input_tokens': 457, 'output_tokens': 17}}, id='run-c21af72d-3cc5-4b74-bb7c-fbeb8f88bd6d-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 457, 'output_tokens': 17, 'total_tokens': 474, 'input_token_details': {}})]}}

Edit Tool Call¶
Let's now say we want to edit the tool call. E.g. change some of the parameters (or even the tool called!) but then execute that tool.
# Input
initial_input = {"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "what's the weather in sf?"}]}

# Thread
thread = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "3"}}

# Run the graph until the first interruption
for event in graph.stream(initial_input, thread, stream_mode="updates"):
    print(event)
    print("\n")

{'call_llm': {'messages': [AIMessage(content=[{'text': "I'll help you check the weather in San Francisco.", 'type': 'text'}, {'id': 'toolu_013eUXow3jwM6eekcDJdrjDa', 'input': {'city': 'sf'}, 'name': 'weather_search', 'type': 'tool_use'}], additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={'id': 'msg_013ruFpCRNZKX3cDeBAH8rEb', 'model': 'claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022', 'stop_reason': 'tool_use', 'stop_sequence': None, 'usage': {'input_tokens': 379, 'output_tokens': 65}}, id='run-13df3982-ce6d-4fe2-9e5c-ea6ce30a63e4-0', tool_calls=[{'name': 'weather_search', 'args': {'city': 'sf'}, 'id': 'toolu_013eUXow3jwM6eekcDJdrjDa', 'type': 'tool_call'}], usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 379, 'output_tokens': 65, 'total_tokens': 444, 'input_token_details': {}})]}}

{'__interrupt__': (Interrupt(value={'question': 'Is this correct?', 'tool_call': {'name': 'weather_search', 'args': {'city': 'sf'}, 'id': 'toolu_013eUXow3jwM6eekcDJdrjDa', 'type': 'tool_call'}}, resumable=True, ns=['human_review_node:da717c23-60a0-2a1a-45de-cac5cff308bb'], when='during'),)}

print("Pending Executions!")
print(graph.get_state(thread).next)

Pending Executions!
('human_review_node',)

To do this, we will use Command with a different resume value of {"action": "update", "data": <tool call args>}. This will do the following:

combine existing tool call with user-provided tool call arguments and update the existing AI message with the new tool call
navigate to run_tool node with the updated AI message and continue execution

# Let's now continue executing from here
for event in graph.stream(
    Command(resume={"action": "update", "data": {"city": "San Francisco, USA"}}),
    thread,
    stream_mode="updates",
):
    print(event)
    print("\n")

{'human_review_node': {'messages': [{'role': 'ai', 'content': [{'text': "I'll help you check the weather in San Francisco.", 'type': 'text'}, {'id': 'toolu_013eUXow3jwM6eekcDJdrjDa', 'input': {'city': 'sf'}, 'name': 'weather_search', 'type': 'tool_use'}], 'tool_calls': [{'id': 'toolu_013eUXow3jwM6eekcDJdrjDa', 'name': 'weather_search', 'args': {'city': 'San Francisco, USA'}}], 'id': 'run-13df3982-ce6d-4fe2-9e5c-ea6ce30a63e4-0'}]}}

Give feedback to a tool call¶
Sometimes, you may not want to execute a tool call, but you also may not want to ask the user to manually modify the tool call. In that case it may be better to get natural language feedback from the user. You can then insert this feedback as a mock RESULT of the tool call.
There are multiple ways to do this:

You could add a new message to the state (representing the "result" of a tool call)
You could add TWO new messages to the state - one representing an "error" from the tool call, other HumanMessage representing the feedback

Both are similar in that they involve adding messages to the state. The main difference lies in the logic AFTER the human_review_node and how it handles different types of messages.
For this example we will just add a single tool call representing the feedback (see human_review_node implementation). Let's see this in action!
# Input
initial_input = {"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "what's the weather in sf?"}]}

# Thread
thread = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "4"}}

# Run the graph until the first interruption
for event in graph.stream(initial_input, thread, stream_mode="updates"):
    print(event)
    print("\n")

{'call_llm': {'messages': [AIMessage(content=[{'text': "I'll help you check the weather in San Francisco.", 'type': 'text'}, {'id': 'toolu_01QxXNTCasnNLQCGAiVoNUBe', 'input': {'city': 'sf'}, 'name': 'weather_search', 'type': 'tool_use'}], additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={'id': 'msg_01DjwkVxgfqT2K329rGkycx6', 'model': 'claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022', 'stop_reason': 'tool_use', 'stop_sequence': None, 'usage': {'input_tokens': 379, 'output_tokens': 65}}, id='run-c57bee36-9f5f-4d2e-85df-758b56d3cc05-0', tool_calls=[{'name': 'weather_search', 'args': {'city': 'sf'}, 'id': 'toolu_01QxXNTCasnNLQCGAiVoNUBe', 'type': 'tool_call'}], usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 379, 'output_tokens': 65, 'total_tokens': 444, 'input_token_details': {}})]}}

{'__interrupt__': (Interrupt(value={'question': 'Is this correct?', 'tool_call': {'name': 'weather_search', 'args': {'city': 'sf'}, 'id': 'toolu_01QxXNTCasnNLQCGAiVoNUBe', 'type': 'tool_call'}}, resumable=True, ns=['human_review_node:47a3f541-b630-5f8a-32d7-5a44826d99da'], when='during'),)}

print("Pending Executions!")
print(graph.get_state(thread).next)

Pending Executions!
('human_review_node',)

To do this, we will use Command with a different resume value of {"action": "feedback", "data": <feedback string>}. This will do the following:

create a new tool message that combines existing tool call from LLM with the with user-provided feedback as content
navigate to call_llm node with the updated tool message and continue execution

# Let's now continue executing from here
for event in graph.stream(
    # provide our natural language feedback!
    Command(
        resume={
            "action": "feedback",
            "data": "User requested changes: use <city, country> format for location",
        }
    ),
    thread,
    stream_mode="updates",
):
    print(event)
    print("\n")

{'human_review_node': {'messages': [{'role': 'tool', 'content': 'User requested changes: use <city, country> format for location', 'name': 'weather_search', 'tool_call_id': 'toolu_01QxXNTCasnNLQCGAiVoNUBe'}]}}

{'call_llm': {'messages': [AIMessage(content=[{'text': 'Let me try again with the full city name.', 'type': 'text'}, {'id': 'toolu_01WBGTKBWusaPNZYJi5LKmeQ', 'input': {'city': 'San Francisco, USA'}, 'name': 'weather_search', 'type': 'tool_use'}], additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={'id': 'msg_0141KCdx6KhJmWXyYwAYGvmj', 'model': 'claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022', 'stop_reason': 'tool_use', 'stop_sequence': None, 'usage': {'input_tokens': 468, 'output_tokens': 68}}, id='run-60c8267a-52c7-4b6e-87ca-16aa3bd6266b-0', tool_calls=[{'name': 'weather_search', 'args': {'city': 'San Francisco, USA'}, 'id': 'toolu_01WBGTKBWusaPNZYJi5LKmeQ', 'type': 'tool_call'}], usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 468, 'output_tokens': 68, 'total_tokens': 536, 'input_token_details': {}})]}}

{'__interrupt__': (Interrupt(value={'question': 'Is this correct?', 'tool_call': {'name': 'weather_search', 'args': {'city': 'San Francisco, USA'}, 'id': 'toolu_01WBGTKBWusaPNZYJi5LKmeQ', 'type': 'tool_call'}}, resumable=True, ns=['human_review_node:621fc4a9-bbf1-9a99-f50b-3bf91675234e'], when='during'),)}

We can see that we now get to another interrupt - because it went back to the model and got an entirely new prediction of what to call. Let's now approve this one and continue.

How to wait for user input (Functional API)¶

Prerequisites
This guide assumes familiarity with the following:

Implementing human-in-the-loop workflows with interrupt
How to create a ReAct agent using the Functional API

Human-in-the-loop (HIL) interactions are crucial for agentic systems. Waiting for human input is a common HIL interaction pattern, allowing the agent to ask the user clarifying questions and await input before proceeding. 
We can implement this in LangGraph using the interrupt() function. interrupt allows us to stop graph execution to collect input from a user and continue execution with collected input.
This guide demonstrates how to implement human-in-the-loop workflows using LangGraph's Functional API. Specifically, we will demonstrate:

A simple usage example
How to use with a ReAct agent

Setup¶
First, let's install the required packages and set our API keys:
%%capture --no-stderr
%pip install -U langgraph langchain-openai

import getpass
import os

def _set_env(var: str):
    if not os.environ.get(var):
        os.environ[var] = getpass.getpass(f"{var}: ")

_set_env("OPENAI_API_KEY")

Simple usage¶
Let's demonstrate a simple usage example. We will create three tasks:

Append "bar".
Pause for human input. When resuming, append human input.
Append "qux".

from langgraph.func import entrypoint, task
from langgraph.types import Command, interrupt

@task
def step_1(input_query):
    """Append bar."""
    return f"{input_query} bar"

@task
def human_feedback(input_query):
    """Append user input."""
    feedback = interrupt(f"Please provide feedback: {input_query}")
    return f"{input_query} {feedback}"

@task
def step_3(input_query):
    """Append qux."""
    return f"{input_query} qux"

API Reference: entrypoint | task | Command | interrupt
We can now compose these tasks in a simple entrypoint:
from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver

checkpointer = MemorySaver()

@entrypoint(checkpointer=checkpointer)
def graph(input_query):
    result_1 = step_1(input_query).result()
    result_2 = human_feedback(result_1).result()
    result_3 = step_3(result_2).result()

    return result_3

API Reference: MemorySaver
All we have done to enable human-in-the-loop workflows is called interrupt() inside a task.

Tip
The results of prior tasks-- in this case step_1-- are persisted, so that they are not run again following the interrupt.

Let's send in a query string:
config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "1"}}

for event in graph.stream("foo", config):
    print(event)
    print("\n")

{'step_1': 'foo bar'}

{'__interrupt__': (Interrupt(value='Please provide feedback: foo bar', resumable=True, ns=['graph:d66b2e35-0ee3-d8d6-1a22-aec9d58f13b9', 'human_feedback:e0cd4ee2-b874-e1d2-8bc4-3f7ddc06bcc2'], when='during'),)}

Note that we've paused with an interrupt after step_1. The interrupt provides instructions to resume the run. To resume, we issue a Command containing the data expected by the human_feedback task.
# Continue execution
for event in graph.stream(Command(resume="baz"), config):
    print(event)
    print("\n")

{'human_feedback': 'foo bar baz'}

{'step_3': 'foo bar baz qux'}

{'graph': 'foo bar baz qux'}

After resuming, the run proceeds through the remaining step and terminates as expected.
Agent¶
We will build off of the agent created in the How to create a ReAct agent using the Functional API guide.
Here we will extend the agent by allowing it to reach out to a human for assistance when needed.
Define model and tools¶
Let's first define the tools and model we will use for our example. As in the ReAct agent guide, we will use a single place-holder tool that gets a description of the weather for a location.
We will use an OpenAI chat model for this example, but any model supporting tool-calling will suffice.
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from langchain_core.tools import tool

model = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o-mini")

@tool
def get_weather(location: str):
    """Call to get the weather from a specific location."""
    # This is a placeholder for the actual implementation
    if any([city in location.lower() for city in ["sf", "san francisco"]]):
        return "It's sunny!"
    elif "boston" in location.lower():
        return "It's rainy!"
    else:
        return f"I am not sure what the weather is in {location}"

API Reference: ChatOpenAI | tool
To reach out to a human for assistance, we can simply add a tool that calls interrupt:
from langgraph.types import Command, interrupt

@tool
def human_assistance(query: str) -> str:
    """Request assistance from a human."""
    human_response = interrupt({"query": query})
    return human_response["data"]

tools = [get_weather, human_assistance]

API Reference: Command | interrupt
Define tasks¶
Our tasks are otherwise unchanged from the ReAct agent guide:

Call model: We want to query our chat model with a list of messages.
Call tool: If our model generates tool calls, we want to execute them.

We just have one more tool accessible to the model.
from langchain_core.messages import ToolMessage
from langgraph.func import entrypoint, task

tools_by_name = {tool.name: tool for tool in tools}

@task
def call_model(messages):
    """Call model with a sequence of messages."""
    response = model.bind_tools(tools).invoke(messages)
    return response

@task
def call_tool(tool_call):
    tool = tools_by_name[tool_call["name"]]
    observation = tool.invoke(tool_call)
    return ToolMessage(content=observation, tool_call_id=tool_call["id"])

API Reference: ToolMessage | entrypoint | task
Define entrypoint¶
Our entrypoint is also unchanged from the ReAct agent guide:
from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver
from langgraph.graph.message import add_messages

checkpointer = MemorySaver()

@entrypoint(checkpointer=checkpointer)
def agent(messages, previous):
    if previous is not None:
        messages = add_messages(previous, messages)

    llm_response = call_model(messages).result()
    while True:
        if not llm_response.tool_calls:
            break

        # Execute tools
        tool_result_futures = [
            call_tool(tool_call) for tool_call in llm_response.tool_calls
        ]
        tool_results = [fut.result() for fut in tool_result_futures]

        # Append to message list
        messages = add_messages(messages, [llm_response, *tool_results])

        # Call model again
        llm_response = call_model(messages).result()

    # Generate final response
    messages = add_messages(messages, llm_response)
    return entrypoint.final(value=llm_response, save=messages)

API Reference: MemorySaver | add_messages
Usage¶
Let's invoke our model with a question that requires human assistance. Our question will also require an invocation of the get_weather tool:
def _print_step(step: dict) -> None:
    for task_name, result in step.items():
        if task_name == "agent":
            continue  # just stream from tasks
        print(f"\n{task_name}:")
        if task_name == "__interrupt__":
            print(result)
        else:
            result.pretty_print()

config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "1"}}

user_message = {
    "role": "user",
    "content": (
        "Can you reach out for human assistance: what should I feed my cat? "
        "Separately, can you check the weather in San Francisco?"
    ),
}
print(user_message)

for step in agent.stream([user_message], config):
    _print_step(step)

{'role': 'user', 'content': 'Can you reach out for human assistance: what should I feed my cat? Separately, can you check the weather in San Francisco?'}

call_model:
==================================[1m Ai Message [0m==================================
Tool Calls:
  human_assistance (call_joAEBVX7Abfm7TsZ0k95ZkVx)
 Call ID: call_joAEBVX7Abfm7TsZ0k95ZkVx
  Args:
    query: What should I feed my cat?
  get_weather (call_ut7zfHFCcms63BOZLrRHszGH)
 Call ID: call_ut7zfHFCcms63BOZLrRHszGH
  Args:
    location: San Francisco

call_tool:
=================================[1m Tool Message [0m=================================

content="It's sunny!" name='get_weather' tool_call_id='call_ut7zfHFCcms63BOZLrRHszGH'

__interrupt__:
(Interrupt(value={'query': 'What should I feed my cat?'}, resumable=True, ns=['agent:aa676ccc-b038-25e3-9c8a-18e81d4e1372', 'call_tool:059d53d2-3344-13bc-e170-48b632c2dd97'], when='during'),)

Note that we generate two tool calls, and although our run is interrupted, we did not block the execution of the get_weather tool.
Let's inspect where we're interrupted:
print(step)

{'__interrupt__': (Interrupt(value={'query': 'What should I feed my cat?'}, resumable=True, ns=['agent:aa676ccc-b038-25e3-9c8a-18e81d4e1372', 'call_tool:059d53d2-3344-13bc-e170-48b632c2dd97'], when='during'),)}

We can resume execution by issuing a Command. Note that the data we supply in the Command can be customized to your needs based on the implementation of human_assistance.
human_response = "You should feed your cat a fish."
human_command = Command(resume={"data": human_response})

for step in agent.stream(human_command, config):
    _print_step(step)

call_tool:
=================================[1m Tool Message [0m=================================

content='You should feed your cat a fish.' name='human_assistance' tool_call_id='call_joAEBVX7Abfm7TsZ0k95ZkVx'

call_model:
==================================[1m Ai Message [0m==================================

For human assistance, you should feed your cat fish. 

Regarding the weather in San Francisco, it's sunny!

Above, when we resume we provide the final tool message, allowing the model to generate its response. Check out the LangSmith traces to see a full breakdown of the runs:

CONTENT:
How to add semantic search to your agent's memory¶
This guide shows how to enable semantic search in your agent's memory store. This lets search for items in the store by semantic similarity.

Tip
This guide assumes familiarity with the memory in LangGraph.

First, install this guide's prerequisites.
%%capture --no-stderr
%pip install -U langgraph langchain-openai langchain

import getpass
import os

def _set_env(var: str):
    if not os.environ.get(var):
        os.environ[var] = getpass.getpass(f"{var}: ")

_set_env("OPENAI_API_KEY")

Next, create the store with an index configuration. By default, stores are configured without semantic/vector search. You can opt in to indexing items when creating the store by providing an IndexConfig to the store's constructor. If your store class does not implement this interface, or if you do not pass in an index configuration, semantic search is disabled, and all index arguments passed to put or aput will have no effect. Below is an example.
from langchain.embeddings import init_embeddings
from langgraph.store.memory import InMemoryStore

# Create store with semantic search enabled
embeddings = init_embeddings("openai:text-embedding-3-small")
store = InMemoryStore(
    index={
        "embed": embeddings,
        "dims": 1536,
    }
)

API Reference: init_embeddings
/var/folders/gf/6rnp_mbx5914kx7qmmh7xzmw0000gn/T/ipykernel_83572/2318027494.py:5: LangChainBetaWarning: The function `init_embeddings` is in beta. It is actively being worked on, so the API may change.
  embeddings = init_embeddings("openai:text-embedding-3-small")

Now let's store some memories:
# Store some memories
store.put(("user_123", "memories"), "1", {"text": "I love pizza"})
store.put(("user_123", "memories"), "2", {"text": "I prefer Italian food"})
store.put(("user_123", "memories"), "3", {"text": "I don't like spicy food"})
store.put(("user_123", "memories"), "3", {"text": "I am studying econometrics"})
store.put(("user_123", "memories"), "3", {"text": "I am a plumber"})

Search memories using natural language:
# Find memories about food preferences
memories = store.search(("user_123", "memories"), query="I like food?", limit=5)

for memory in memories:
    print(f'Memory: {memory.value["text"]} (similarity: {memory.score})')

Memory: I prefer Italian food (similarity: 0.46482669521168163)
Memory: I love pizza (similarity: 0.35514845174380766)
Memory: I am a plumber (similarity: 0.155698702336571)

Using in your agent¶
Add semantic search to any node by injecting the store.
from typing import Optional

from langchain.chat_models import init_chat_model
from langgraph.store.base import BaseStore

from langgraph.graph import START, MessagesState, StateGraph

llm = init_chat_model("openai:gpt-4o-mini")

def chat(state, *, store: BaseStore):
    # Search based on user's last message
    items = store.search(
        ("user_123", "memories"), query=state["messages"][-1].content, limit=2
    )
    memories = "\n".join(item.value["text"] for item in items)
    memories = f"## Memories of user\n{memories}" if memories else ""
    response = llm.invoke(
        [
            {"role": "system", "content": f"You are a helpful assistant.\n{memories}"},
            *state["messages"],
        ]
    )
    return {"messages": [response]}

builder = StateGraph(MessagesState)
builder.add_node(chat)
builder.add_edge(START, "chat")
graph = builder.compile(store=store)

for message, metadata in graph.stream(
    input={"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "I'm hungry"}]},
    stream_mode="messages",
):
    print(message.content, end="")

API Reference: init_chat_model | START | StateGraph
What are you in the mood for? Since you love Italian food and pizza, would you like to order a pizza or try making one at home?

Using in create_react_agent¶
Add semantic search to your tool calling agent by injecting the store in the prompt function. You can also use the store in a tool to let your agent manually store or search for memories.
import uuid
from typing import Optional

from langchain.chat_models import init_chat_model
from langgraph.prebuilt import InjectedStore
from langgraph.store.base import BaseStore
from typing_extensions import Annotated

from langgraph.prebuilt import create_react_agent

def prepare_messages(state, *, store: BaseStore):
    # Search based on user's last message
    items = store.search(
        ("user_123", "memories"), query=state["messages"][-1].content, limit=2
    )
    memories = "\n".join(item.value["text"] for item in items)
    memories = f"## Memories of user\n{memories}" if memories else ""
    return [
        {"role": "system", "content": f"You are a helpful assistant.\n{memories}"}
    ] + state["messages"]

# You can also use the store directly within a tool!
def upsert_memory(
    content: str,
    *,
    memory_id: Optional[uuid.UUID] = None,
    store: Annotated[BaseStore, InjectedStore],
):
    """Upsert a memory in the database."""
    # The LLM can use this tool to store a new memory
    mem_id = memory_id or uuid.uuid4()
    store.put(
        ("user_123", "memories"),
        key=str(mem_id),
        value={"text": content},
    )
    return f"Stored memory {mem_id}"

agent = create_react_agent(
    init_chat_model("openai:gpt-4o-mini"),
    tools=[upsert_memory],
    # The 'prompt' function is run to prepare the messages for the LLM. It is called
    # right before each LLM call
    prompt=prepare_messages,
    store=store,
)

API Reference: init_chat_model | create_react_agent
for message, metadata in agent.stream(
    input={"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "I'm hungry"}]},
    stream_mode="messages",
):
    print(message.content, end="")

What are you in the mood for? Since you love Italian food and pizza, maybe something in that realm would be great! Would you like suggestions for a specific dish or restaurant?

Advanced Usage¶
Multi-vector indexing¶
Store and search different aspects of memories separately to improve recall or omit certain fields from being indexed.
# Configure store to embed both memory content and emotional context
store = InMemoryStore(
    index={"embed": embeddings, "dims": 1536, "fields": ["memory", "emotional_context"]}
)
# Store memories with different content/emotion pairs
store.put(
    ("user_123", "memories"),
    "mem1",
    {
        "memory": "Had pizza with friends at Mario's",
        "emotional_context": "felt happy and connected",
        "this_isnt_indexed": "I prefer ravioli though",
    },
)
store.put(
    ("user_123", "memories"),
    "mem2",
    {
        "memory": "Ate alone at home",
        "emotional_context": "felt a bit lonely",
        "this_isnt_indexed": "I like pie",
    },
)

# Search focusing on emotional state - matches mem2
results = store.search(
    ("user_123", "memories"), query="times they felt isolated", limit=1
)
print("Expect mem 2")
for r in results:
    print(f"Item: {r.key}; Score ({r.score})")
    print(f"Memory: {r.value['memory']}")
    print(f"Emotion: {r.value['emotional_context']}\n")

# Search focusing on social eating - matches mem1
print("Expect mem1")
results = store.search(("user_123", "memories"), query="fun pizza", limit=1)
for r in results:
    print(f"Item: {r.key}; Score ({r.score})")
    print(f"Memory: {r.value['memory']}")
    print(f"Emotion: {r.value['emotional_context']}\n")

print("Expect random lower score (ravioli not indexed)")
results = store.search(("user_123", "memories"), query="ravioli", limit=1)
for r in results:
    print(f"Item: {r.key}; Score ({r.score})")
    print(f"Memory: {r.value['memory']}")
    print(f"Emotion: {r.value['emotional_context']}\n")

Expect mem 2
Item: mem2; Score (0.5895009051396596)
Memory: Ate alone at home
Emotion: felt a bit lonely

Expect mem1
Item: mem1; Score (0.6207546534134083)
Memory: Had pizza with friends at Mario's
Emotion: felt happy and connected

Expect random lower score (ravioli not indexed)
Item: mem1; Score (0.2686278787315685)
Memory: Had pizza with friends at Mario's
Emotion: felt happy and connected

Override fields at storage time¶
You can override which fields to embed when storing a specific memory using put(..., index=[...fields]), regardless of the store's default configuration.
store = InMemoryStore(
    index={
        "embed": embeddings,
        "dims": 1536,
        "fields": ["memory"],
    }  # Default to embed memory field
)

# Store one memory with default indexing
store.put(
    ("user_123", "memories"),
    "mem1",
    {"memory": "I love spicy food", "context": "At a Thai restaurant"},
)

# Store another overriding which fields to embed
store.put(
    ("user_123", "memories"),
    "mem2",
    {"memory": "The restaurant was too loud", "context": "Dinner at an Italian place"},
    index=["context"],  # Override: only embed the context
)

# Search about food - matches mem1 (using default field)
print("Expect mem1")
results = store.search(
    ("user_123", "memories"), query="what food do they like", limit=1
)
for r in results:
    print(f"Item: {r.key}; Score ({r.score})")
    print(f"Memory: {r.value['memory']}")
    print(f"Context: {r.value['context']}\n")

# Search about restaurant atmosphere - matches mem2 (using overridden field)
print("Expect mem2")
results = store.search(
    ("user_123", "memories"), query="restaurant environment", limit=1
)
for r in results:
    print(f"Item: {r.key}; Score ({r.score})")
    print(f"Memory: {r.value['memory']}")
    print(f"Context: {r.value['context']}\n")

Expect mem1
Item: mem1; Score (0.3374968677940555)
Memory: I love spicy food
Context: At a Thai restaurant

Expect mem2
Item: mem2; Score (0.36784461593247436)
Memory: The restaurant was too loud
Context: Dinner at an Italian place

Disable Indexing for Specific Memories¶
Some memories shouldn't be searchable by content. You can disable indexing for these while still storing them using 
put(..., index=False). Example:
store = InMemoryStore(index={"embed": embeddings, "dims": 1536, "fields": ["memory"]})

# Store a normal indexed memory
store.put(
    ("user_123", "memories"),
    "mem1",
    {"memory": "I love chocolate ice cream", "type": "preference"},
)

# Store a system memory without indexing
store.put(
    ("user_123", "memories"),
    "mem2",
    {"memory": "User completed onboarding", "type": "system"},
    index=False,  # Disable indexing entirely
)

# Search about food preferences - finds mem1
print("Expect mem1")
results = store.search(("user_123", "memories"), query="what food preferences", limit=1)
for r in results:
    print(f"Item: {r.key}; Score ({r.score})")
    print(f"Memory: {r.value['memory']}")
    print(f"Type: {r.value['type']}\n")

# Search about onboarding - won't find mem2 (not indexed)
print("Expect low score (mem2 not indexed)")
results = store.search(("user_123", "memories"), query="onboarding status", limit=1)
for r in results:
    print(f"Item: {r.key}; Score ({r.score})")
    print(f"Memory: {r.value['memory']}")
    print(f"Type: {r.value['type']}\n")

Expect mem1
Item: mem1; Score (0.32269984224327286)
Memory: I love chocolate ice cream
Type: preference

Expect low score (mem2 not indexed)
Item: mem1; Score (0.010241633698527089)
Memory: I love chocolate ice cream
Type: preference

CONTENT:
How to create a ReAct agent from scratch (Functional API)¶

Prerequisites
This guide assumes familiarity with the following:

Chat Models
Messages
Tool Calling
Entrypoints and Tasks

This guide demonstrates how to implement a ReAct agent using the LangGraph Functional API.
The ReAct agent is a tool-calling agent that operates as follows:

Queries are issued to a chat model;
If the model generates no tool calls, we return the model response.
If the model generates tool calls, we execute the tool calls with available tools, append them as tool messages to our message list, and repeat the process.

This is a simple and versatile set-up that can be extended with memory, human-in-the-loop capabilities, and other features. See the dedicated how-to guides for examples.
Setup¶
First, let's install the required packages and set our API keys:
%%capture --no-stderr
%pip install -U langgraph langchain-openai

import getpass
import os

def _set_env(var: str):
    if not os.environ.get(var):
        os.environ[var] = getpass.getpass(f"{var}: ")

_set_env("OPENAI_API_KEY")

Set up LangSmith for better debugging

         Sign up for LangSmith to quickly spot issues and improve the performance of your LangGraph projects. LangSmith lets you use trace data to debug, test, and monitor your LLM aps built with LangGraph — read more about how to get started in the docs. 
     

Create ReAct agent¶
Now that you have installed the required packages and set your environment variables, we can create our agent.
Define model and tools¶
Let's first define the tools and model we will use for our example. Here we will use a single place-holder tool that gets a description of the weather for a location.
We will use an OpenAI chat model for this example, but any model supporting tool-calling will suffice.
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from langchain_core.tools import tool

model = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o-mini")

@tool
def get_weather(location: str):
    """Call to get the weather from a specific location."""
    # This is a placeholder for the actual implementation
    if any([city in location.lower() for city in ["sf", "san francisco"]]):
        return "It's sunny!"
    elif "boston" in location.lower():
        return "It's rainy!"
    else:
        return f"I am not sure what the weather is in {location}"

tools = [get_weather]

API Reference: ChatOpenAI | tool
Define tasks¶
We next define the tasks we will execute. Here there are two different tasks:

Call model: We want to query our chat model with a list of messages.
Call tool: If our model generates tool calls, we want to execute them.

from langchain_core.messages import ToolMessage
from langgraph.func import entrypoint, task

tools_by_name = {tool.name: tool for tool in tools}

@task
def call_model(messages):
    """Call model with a sequence of messages."""
    response = model.bind_tools(tools).invoke(messages)
    return response

@task
def call_tool(tool_call):
    tool = tools_by_name[tool_call["name"]]
    observation = tool.invoke(tool_call["args"])
    return ToolMessage(content=observation, tool_call_id=tool_call["id"])

API Reference: ToolMessage | entrypoint | task
Define entrypoint¶
Our entrypoint will handle the orchestration of these two tasks. As described above, when our call_model task generates tool calls, the call_tool task will generate responses for each. We append all messages to a single messages list.

Tip
Note that because tasks return future-like objects, the below implementation executes tools in parallel.

from langgraph.graph.message import add_messages

@entrypoint()
def agent(messages):
    llm_response = call_model(messages).result()
    while True:
        if not llm_response.tool_calls:
            break

        # Execute tools
        tool_result_futures = [
            call_tool(tool_call) for tool_call in llm_response.tool_calls
        ]
        tool_results = [fut.result() for fut in tool_result_futures]

        # Append to message list
        messages = add_messages(messages, [llm_response, *tool_results])

        # Call model again
        llm_response = call_model(messages).result()

    return llm_response

API Reference: add_messages
Usage¶
To use our agent, we invoke it with a messages list. Based on our implementation, these can be LangChain message objects or OpenAI-style dicts:
user_message = {"role": "user", "content": "What's the weather in san francisco?"}
print(user_message)

for step in agent.stream([user_message]):
    for task_name, message in step.items():
        if task_name == "agent":
            continue  # Just print task updates
        print(f"\n{task_name}:")
        message.pretty_print()

{'role': 'user', 'content': "What's the weather in san francisco?"}

call_model:
==================================[1m Ai Message [0m==================================
Tool Calls:
  get_weather (call_tNnkrjnoz6MNfCHJpwfuEQ0v)
 Call ID: call_tNnkrjnoz6MNfCHJpwfuEQ0v
  Args:
    location: san francisco

call_tool:
=================================[1m Tool Message [0m=================================

It's sunny!

call_model:
==================================[1m Ai Message [0m==================================

The weather in San Francisco is sunny!

Perfect! The graph correctly calls the get_weather tool and responds to the user after receiving the information from the tool. Check out the LangSmith trace here.
Add thread-level persistence¶
Adding thread-level persistence lets us support conversational experiences with our agent: subsequent invocations will append to the prior messages list, retaining the full conversational context.
To add thread-level persistence to our agent:

Select a checkpointer: here we will use MemorySaver, a simple in-memory checkpointer.
Update our entrypoint to accept the previous messages state as a second argument. Here, we simply append the message updates to the previous sequence of messages.
Choose which values will be returned from the workflow and which will be saved by the checkpointer as previous using entrypoint.final (optional)

from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver

checkpointer = MemorySaver()

@entrypoint(checkpointer=checkpointer)
def agent(messages, previous):
    if previous is not None:
        messages = add_messages(previous, messages)

    llm_response = call_model(messages).result()
    while True:
        if not llm_response.tool_calls:
            break

        # Execute tools
        tool_result_futures = [
            call_tool(tool_call) for tool_call in llm_response.tool_calls
        ]
        tool_results = [fut.result() for fut in tool_result_futures]

        # Append to message list
        messages = add_messages(messages, [llm_response, *tool_results])

        # Call model again
        llm_response = call_model(messages).result()

    # Generate final response
    messages = add_messages(messages, llm_response)
    return entrypoint.final(value=llm_response, save=messages)

API Reference: MemorySaver
We will now need to pass in a config when running our application. The config will specify an identifier for the conversational thread.

Tip
Read more about thread-level persistence in our concepts page and how-to guides.

config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "1"}}

We start a thread the same way as before, this time passing in the config:
user_message = {"role": "user", "content": "What's the weather in san francisco?"}
print(user_message)

for step in agent.stream([user_message], config):
    for task_name, message in step.items():
        if task_name == "agent":
            continue  # Just print task updates
        print(f"\n{task_name}:")
        message.pretty_print()

{'role': 'user', 'content': "What's the weather in san francisco?"}

call_model:
==================================[1m Ai Message [0m==================================
Tool Calls:
  get_weather (call_lubbUSdDofmOhFunPEZLBz3g)
 Call ID: call_lubbUSdDofmOhFunPEZLBz3g
  Args:
    location: San Francisco

call_tool:
=================================[1m Tool Message [0m=================================

It's sunny!

call_model:
==================================[1m Ai Message [0m==================================

The weather in San Francisco is sunny!

When we ask a follow-up conversation, the model uses the prior context to infer that we are asking about the weather:
user_message = {"role": "user", "content": "How does it compare to Boston, MA?"}
print(user_message)

for step in agent.stream([user_message], config):
    for task_name, message in step.items():
        if task_name == "agent":
            continue  # Just print task updates
        print(f"\n{task_name}:")
        message.pretty_print()

{'role': 'user', 'content': 'How does it compare to Boston, MA?'}

call_model:
==================================[1m Ai Message [0m==================================
Tool Calls:
  get_weather (call_8sTKYAhSIHOdjLD5d6gaswuV)
 Call ID: call_8sTKYAhSIHOdjLD5d6gaswuV
  Args:
    location: Boston, MA

call_tool:
=================================[1m Tool Message [0m=================================

It's rainy!

call_model:
==================================[1m Ai Message [0m==================================

Compared to San Francisco, which is sunny, Boston, MA is experiencing rainy weather.

In the LangSmith trace, we can see that the full conversational context is retained in each model call.

CONTENT:
How to create a ReAct agent from scratch (Functional API)¶

Prerequisites
This guide assumes familiarity with the following:

Chat Models
Messages
Tool Calling
Entrypoints and Tasks

This guide demonstrates how to implement a ReAct agent using the LangGraph Functional API.
The ReAct agent is a tool-calling agent that operates as follows:

Queries are issued to a chat model;
If the model generates no tool calls, we return the model response.
If the model generates tool calls, we execute the tool calls with available tools, append them as tool messages to our message list, and repeat the process.

This is a simple and versatile set-up that can be extended with memory, human-in-the-loop capabilities, and other features. See the dedicated how-to guides for examples.
Setup¶
First, let's install the required packages and set our API keys:
%%capture --no-stderr
%pip install -U langgraph langchain-openai

import getpass
import os

def _set_env(var: str):
    if not os.environ.get(var):
        os.environ[var] = getpass.getpass(f"{var}: ")

_set_env("OPENAI_API_KEY")

Set up LangSmith for better debugging

         Sign up for LangSmith to quickly spot issues and improve the performance of your LangGraph projects. LangSmith lets you use trace data to debug, test, and monitor your LLM aps built with LangGraph — read more about how to get started in the docs. 
     

Create ReAct agent¶
Now that you have installed the required packages and set your environment variables, we can create our agent.
Define model and tools¶
Let's first define the tools and model we will use for our example. Here we will use a single place-holder tool that gets a description of the weather for a location.
We will use an OpenAI chat model for this example, but any model supporting tool-calling will suffice.
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from langchain_core.tools import tool

model = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o-mini")

@tool
def get_weather(location: str):
    """Call to get the weather from a specific location."""
    # This is a placeholder for the actual implementation
    if any([city in location.lower() for city in ["sf", "san francisco"]]):
        return "It's sunny!"
    elif "boston" in location.lower():
        return "It's rainy!"
    else:
        return f"I am not sure what the weather is in {location}"

tools = [get_weather]

API Reference: ChatOpenAI | tool
Define tasks¶
We next define the tasks we will execute. Here there are two different tasks:

Call model: We want to query our chat model with a list of messages.
Call tool: If our model generates tool calls, we want to execute them.

from langchain_core.messages import ToolMessage
from langgraph.func import entrypoint, task

tools_by_name = {tool.name: tool for tool in tools}

@task
def call_model(messages):
    """Call model with a sequence of messages."""
    response = model.bind_tools(tools).invoke(messages)
    return response

@task
def call_tool(tool_call):
    tool = tools_by_name[tool_call["name"]]
    observation = tool.invoke(tool_call["args"])
    return ToolMessage(content=observation, tool_call_id=tool_call["id"])

API Reference: ToolMessage | entrypoint | task
Define entrypoint¶
Our entrypoint will handle the orchestration of these two tasks. As described above, when our call_model task generates tool calls, the call_tool task will generate responses for each. We append all messages to a single messages list.

Tip
Note that because tasks return future-like objects, the below implementation executes tools in parallel.

from langgraph.graph.message import add_messages

@entrypoint()
def agent(messages):
    llm_response = call_model(messages).result()
    while True:
        if not llm_response.tool_calls:
            break

        # Execute tools
        tool_result_futures = [
            call_tool(tool_call) for tool_call in llm_response.tool_calls
        ]
        tool_results = [fut.result() for fut in tool_result_futures]

        # Append to message list
        messages = add_messages(messages, [llm_response, *tool_results])

        # Call model again
        llm_response = call_model(messages).result()

    return llm_response

API Reference: add_messages
Usage¶
To use our agent, we invoke it with a messages list. Based on our implementation, these can be LangChain message objects or OpenAI-style dicts:
user_message = {"role": "user", "content": "What's the weather in san francisco?"}
print(user_message)

for step in agent.stream([user_message]):
    for task_name, message in step.items():
        if task_name == "agent":
            continue  # Just print task updates
        print(f"\n{task_name}:")
        message.pretty_print()

{'role': 'user', 'content': "What's the weather in san francisco?"}

call_model:
==================================[1m Ai Message [0m==================================
Tool Calls:
  get_weather (call_tNnkrjnoz6MNfCHJpwfuEQ0v)
 Call ID: call_tNnkrjnoz6MNfCHJpwfuEQ0v
  Args:
    location: san francisco

call_tool:
=================================[1m Tool Message [0m=================================

It's sunny!

call_model:
==================================[1m Ai Message [0m==================================

The weather in San Francisco is sunny!

Perfect! The graph correctly calls the get_weather tool and responds to the user after receiving the information from the tool. Check out the LangSmith trace here.
Add thread-level persistence¶
Adding thread-level persistence lets us support conversational experiences with our agent: subsequent invocations will append to the prior messages list, retaining the full conversational context.
To add thread-level persistence to our agent:

Select a checkpointer: here we will use MemorySaver, a simple in-memory checkpointer.
Update our entrypoint to accept the previous messages state as a second argument. Here, we simply append the message updates to the previous sequence of messages.
Choose which values will be returned from the workflow and which will be saved by the checkpointer as previous using entrypoint.final (optional)

from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver

checkpointer = MemorySaver()

@entrypoint(checkpointer=checkpointer)
def agent(messages, previous):
    if previous is not None:
        messages = add_messages(previous, messages)

    llm_response = call_model(messages).result()
    while True:
        if not llm_response.tool_calls:
            break

        # Execute tools
        tool_result_futures = [
            call_tool(tool_call) for tool_call in llm_response.tool_calls
        ]
        tool_results = [fut.result() for fut in tool_result_futures]

        # Append to message list
        messages = add_messages(messages, [llm_response, *tool_results])

        # Call model again
        llm_response = call_model(messages).result()

    # Generate final response
    messages = add_messages(messages, llm_response)
    return entrypoint.final(value=llm_response, save=messages)

API Reference: MemorySaver
We will now need to pass in a config when running our application. The config will specify an identifier for the conversational thread.

Tip
Read more about thread-level persistence in our concepts page and how-to guides.

config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "1"}}

We start a thread the same way as before, this time passing in the config:
user_message = {"role": "user", "content": "What's the weather in san francisco?"}
print(user_message)

for step in agent.stream([user_message], config):
    for task_name, message in step.items():
        if task_name == "agent":
            continue  # Just print task updates
        print(f"\n{task_name}:")
        message.pretty_print()

{'role': 'user', 'content': "What's the weather in san francisco?"}

        if task_name == "agent":
            continue  # Just print task updates
        print(f"\n{task_name}:")
        message.pretty_print()

Compared to San Francisco, which is sunny, Boston, MA is experiencing rainy weather.

In the LangSmith trace, we can see that the full conversational context is retained in each model call.

CONTENT:
How to return structured output from the prebuilt ReAct agent¶

Prerequisites
This guide assumes familiarity with the following:

Agent Architectures
Chat Models
Tools
Structured Output

To return structured output from the prebuilt ReAct agent you can provide a response_format parameter with the desired output schema to create_react_agent:
class ResponseFormat(BaseModel):
    """Respond to the user in this format."""
    my_special_output: str

graph = create_react_agent(
    model,
    tools=tools,
    # specify the schema for the structured output using `response_format` parameter
    response_format=ResponseFormat
)

Prebuilt ReAct makes an additional LLM call at the end of the ReAct loop to produce a structured output response. Please see this guide to learn about other  strategies for returning structured outputs from a tool-calling agent.
Setup¶
First, let's install the required packages and set our API keys
%%capture --no-stderr
%pip install -U langgraph langchain-openai

import getpass
import os

def _set_env(var: str):
    if not os.environ.get(var):
        os.environ[var] = getpass.getpass(f"{var}: ")

_set_env("OPENAI_API_KEY")

Set up LangSmith for LangGraph development

        Sign up for LangSmith to quickly spot issues and improve the performance of your LangGraph projects. LangSmith lets you use trace data to debug, test, and monitor your LLM apps built with LangGraph — read more about how to get started here. 
    

Code¶
# First we initialize the model we want to use.
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

model = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o", temperature=0)

# For this tutorial we will use custom tool that returns pre-defined values for weather in two cities (NYC & SF)

from typing import Literal
from langchain_core.tools import tool

@tool
def get_weather(city: Literal["nyc", "sf"]):
    """Use this to get weather information."""
    if city == "nyc":
        return "It might be cloudy in nyc"
    elif city == "sf":
        return "It's always sunny in sf"
    else:
        raise AssertionError("Unknown city")

tools = [get_weather]

# Define the structured output schema

from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

class WeatherResponse(BaseModel):
    """Respond to the user in this format."""

    conditions: str = Field(description="Weather conditions")

# Define the graph

from langgraph.prebuilt import create_react_agent

graph = create_react_agent(
    model,
    tools=tools,
    # specify the schema for the structured output using `response_format` parameter
    response_format=WeatherResponse,
)

API Reference: ChatOpenAI | tool | create_react_agent
Usage¶
Let's now test our agent:
inputs = {"messages": [("user", "What's the weather in NYC?")]}
response = graph.invoke(inputs)

You can see that the agent output contains a structured_response key with the structured output conforming to the specified WeatherResponse schema, in addition to the message history under messages key.
response["structured_response"]

WeatherResponse(conditions='cloudy')

Customizing prompt¶
You might need to further customize the second LLM call for the structured output generation and provide a system prompt. To do so, you can pass a tuple (prompt, schema):
graph = create_react_agent(
    model,
    tools=tools,
    # specify both the system prompt and the schema for the structured output
    response_format=("Always return capitalized weather conditions", WeatherResponse),
)

inputs = {"messages": [("user", "What's the weather in NYC?")]}
response = graph.invoke(inputs)

You can verify that the structured response now contains a capitalized value:
response["structured_response"]

WeatherResponse(conditions='Cloudy')

How to add thread-level memory to a ReAct Agent¶

Prerequisites

        This guide assumes familiarity with the following:
        

                    LangGraph Persistence
                

                    Checkpointer interface
                

                    Agent Architectures
                

                    Chat Models
                

                    Tools
                

This guide will show how to add memory to the prebuilt ReAct agent. Please see this tutorial for how to get started with the prebuilt ReAct agent
We can add memory to the agent, by passing a checkpointer to the create_react_agent function.
Setup¶
First, let's install the required packages and set our API keys
%%capture --no-stderr
%pip install -U langgraph langchain-openai

import getpass
import os

def _set_env(var: str):
    if not os.environ.get(var):
        os.environ[var] = getpass.getpass(f"{var}: ")

_set_env("OPENAI_API_KEY")

How to use the pre-built ReAct agent¶

Prerequisites

        This guide assumes familiarity with the following:
        

                    Agent Architectures
                

                    Chat Models
                

                    Tools
                

In this how-to we'll create a simple ReAct agent app that can check the weather. The app consists of an agent (LLM) and tools. As we interact with the app, we will first call the agent (LLM) to decide if we should use tools. Then we will run a loop:  

If the agent said to take an action (i.e. call tool), we'll run the tools and pass the results back to the agent
If the agent did not ask to run tools, we will finish (respond to the user)

Prebuilt Agent

Please note that here will we use a prebuilt agent. One of the big benefits of LangGraph is that you can easily create your own agent architectures. So while it's fine to start here to build an agent quickly, we would strongly recommend learning how to build your own agent so that you can take full advantage of LangGraph.
    

Setup¶
First let's install the required packages and set our API keys
%%capture --no-stderr
%pip install -U langgraph langchain-openai

import getpass
import os

def _set_env(var: str):
    if not os.environ.get(var):
        os.environ[var] = getpass.getpass(f"{var}: ")

_set_env("OPENAI_API_KEY")

Code¶
# First we initialize the model we want to use.
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

model = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o", temperature=0)

# For this tutorial we will use custom tool that returns pre-defined values for weather in two cities (NYC & SF)

from typing import Literal

from langchain_core.tools import tool

@tool
def get_weather(city: Literal["nyc", "sf"]):
    """Use this to get weather information."""
    if city == "nyc":
        return "It might be cloudy in nyc"
    elif city == "sf":
        return "It's always sunny in sf"
    else:
        raise AssertionError("Unknown city")

tools = [get_weather]

# Define the graph

from langgraph.prebuilt import create_react_agent

graph = create_react_agent(model, tools=tools)

API Reference: ChatOpenAI | tool | create_react_agent
Usage¶
First, let's visualize the graph we just created
from IPython.display import Image, display

display(Image(graph.get_graph().draw_mermaid_png()))

def print_stream(stream):
    for s in stream:
        message = s["messages"][-1]
        if isinstance(message, tuple):
            print(message)
        else:
            message.pretty_print()

Let's run the app with an input that needs a tool call
inputs = {"messages": [("user", "what is the weather in sf")]}
print_stream(graph.stream(inputs, stream_mode="values"))

================================[1m Human Message [0m=================================

what is the weather in sf
==================================[1m Ai Message [0m==================================
Tool Calls:

How to manage conversation history in a ReAct Agent¶

Prerequisites
This guide assumes familiarity with the following:

Prebuilt create_react_agent
Persistence
Short-term Memory
Trimming Messages

Message history can grow quickly and exceed LLM context window size, whether you're building chatbots with many conversation turns or agentic systems with numerous tool calls. There are several strategies for managing the message history:

message trimming - remove first or last N messages in the history
summarization - summarize earlier messages in the history and replace them with a summary
custom strategies (e.g., message filtering, etc.)

To manage message history in create_react_agent, you need to define a pre_model_hook function or runnable that takes graph state an returns a state update:

Trimming example:
    from langchain_core.messages.utils import (
    trim_messages, 
    count_tokens_approximately
)
from langgraph.prebuilt import create_react_agent

# This function will be called every time before the node that calls LLM
def pre_model_hook(state):
    trimmed_messages = trim_messages(
        state["messages"],
        strategy="last",
        token_counter=count_tokens_approximately,
        max_tokens=384,
        start_on="human",
        end_on=("human", "tool"),
    )
    # You can return updated messages either under `llm_input_messages` or 
    # `messages` key (see the note below)
    return {"llm_input_messages": trimmed_messages}

checkpointer = InMemorySaver()
agent = create_react_agent(
    model,
    tools,
    pre_model_hook=pre_model_hook,
    checkpointer=checkpointer,
)

Summarization example:
    from langmem.short_term import SummarizationNode
from langchain_core.messages.utils import count_tokens_approximately
from langgraph.prebuilt.chat_agent_executor import AgentState
from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import InMemorySaver
from typing import Any

model = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o")

summarization_node = SummarizationNode(
    token_counter=count_tokens_approximately,
    model=model,
    max_tokens=384,
    max_summary_tokens=128,
    output_messages_key="llm_input_messages",
)

class State(AgentState):
    # NOTE: we're adding this key to keep track of previous summary information
    # to make sure we're not summarizing on every LLM call
    context: dict[str, Any]

checkpointer = InMemorySaver()
graph = create_react_agent(
    model,
    tools,
    pre_model_hook=summarization_node,
    state_schema=State,
    checkpointer=checkpointer,
)

Important

To keep the original message history unmodified in the graph state and pass the updated history only as the input to the LLM, return updated messages under llm_input_messages key
To overwrite the original message history in the graph state with the updated history, return updated messages under messages key

To overwrite the messages key, you need to do the following:
from langchain_core.messages import RemoveMessage
from langgraph.graph.message import REMOVE_ALL_MESSAGES

def pre_model_hook(state):
    updated_messages = ...
    return {
        "messages": [RemoveMessage(id=REMOVE_ALL_MESSAGES), *updated_messages]
        ...
    }

Setup¶
First, let's install the required packages and set our API keys
%%capture --no-stderr
%pip install -U langgraph langchain-openai langmem

import getpass
import os

def _set_env(var: str):
    if not os.environ.get(var):
        os.environ[var] = getpass.getpass(f"{var}: ")

_set_env("OPENAI_API_KEY")

Set up LangSmith for LangGraph development

        Sign up for LangSmith to quickly spot issues and improve the performance of your LangGraph projects. LangSmith lets you use trace data to debug, test, and monitor your LLM apps built with LangGraph — read more about how to get started here. 
    

Keep the original message history unmodified¶
Let's build a ReAct agent with a step that manages the conversation history: when the length of the history exceeds a specified number of tokens, we will call trim_messages utility that that will reduce the history while satisfying LLM provider constraints.
There are two ways that the updated message history can be applied inside ReAct agent:

Keep the original message history unmodified in the graph state and pass the updated history only as the input to the LLM
Overwrite the original message history in the graph state with the updated history

Let's start by implementing the first one. We'll need to first define model and tools for our agent:
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

model = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o", temperature=0)

def get_weather(location: str) -> str:
    """Use this to get weather information."""
    if any([city in location.lower() for city in ["nyc", "new york city"]]):
        return "It might be cloudy in nyc, with a chance of rain and temperatures up to 80 degrees."
    elif any([city in location.lower() for city in ["sf", "san francisco"]]):
        return "It's always sunny in sf"
    else:
        return f"I am not sure what the weather is in {location}"

tools = [get_weather]

API Reference: ChatOpenAI
Now let's implement pre_model_hook — a function that will be added as a new node and called every time before the node that calls the LLM (the agent node).
Our implementation will wrap the trim_messages call and return the trimmed messages under llm_input_messages. This will keep the original message history unmodified in the graph state and pass the updated history only as the input to the LLM
from langgraph.prebuilt import create_react_agent
from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import InMemorySaver

from langchain_core.messages.utils import (
    trim_messages,
    count_tokens_approximately,
)

# This function will be added as a new node in ReAct agent graph
# that will run every time before the node that calls the LLM.
# The messages returned by this function will be the input to the LLM.
def pre_model_hook(state):
    trimmed_messages = trim_messages(
        state["messages"],
        strategy="last",
        token_counter=count_tokens_approximately,
        max_tokens=384,
        start_on="human",
        end_on=("human", "tool"),
    )
    return {"llm_input_messages": trimmed_messages}

checkpointer = InMemorySaver()
graph = create_react_agent(
    model,
    tools,
    pre_model_hook=pre_model_hook,
    checkpointer=checkpointer,
)

API Reference: create_react_agent | trim_messages | count_tokens_approximately
from IPython.display import display, Image

display(Image(graph.get_graph().draw_mermaid_png()))

We'll also define a utility to render the agent outputs nicely:
def print_stream(stream, output_messages_key="llm_input_messages"):
    for chunk in stream:
        for node, update in chunk.items():
            print(f"Update from node: {node}")
            messages_key = (
                output_messages_key if node == "pre_model_hook" else "messages"
            )
            for message in update[messages_key]:
                if isinstance(message, tuple):
                    print(message)
                else:
                    message.pretty_print()

        print("\n\n")

Now let's run the agent with a few different queries to reach the specified max tokens limit:
config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "1"}}

inputs = {"messages": [("user", "What's the weather in NYC?")]}
result = graph.invoke(inputs, config=config)

inputs = {"messages": [("user", "What's it known for?")]}
result = graph.invoke(inputs, config=config)

Let's see how many tokens we have in the message history so far:
messages = result["messages"]
count_tokens_approximately(messages)

415

You can see that we are close to the max_tokens threshold, so on the next invocation we should see pre_model_hook kick-in and trim the message history. Let's run it again:
inputs = {"messages": [("user", "where can i find the best bagel?")]}
print_stream(graph.stream(inputs, config=config, stream_mode="updates"))

Update from node: pre_model_hook

3. **Central Park**: A large public park offering a natural retreat in the middle of the city.
4. **Empire State Building**: An iconic skyscraper offering panoramic views of the city.

Update from node: agent
==================================[1m Ai Message [0m==================================

New York City is famous for its bagels, and there are several places renowned for serving some of the best. Here are a few top spots where you can find excellent bagels in NYC:

1. **Ess-a-Bagel**: Known for their large, chewy bagels with a variety of spreads and toppings.
2. **Russ & Daughters**: A classic spot offering traditional bagels with high-quality smoked fish and cream cheese.
3. **H&H Bagels**: Famous for their fresh, hand-rolled bagels.
4. **Murray’s Bagels**: Offers a wide selection of bagels and spreads, with a no-toasting policy to preserve freshness.
5. **Absolute Bagels**: Known for their authentic, fluffy bagels and a variety of cream cheese options.
6. **Tompkins Square Bagels**: Offers creative bagel sandwiches and a wide range of spreads.
7. **Bagel Hole**: Known for their smaller, denser bagels with a crispy crust.

Each of these places has its own unique style and flavor, so it might be worth trying a few to find your personal favorite!

You can see that the pre_model_hook node now only returned the last 3 messages, as expected. However, the existing message history is untouched:
updated_messages = graph.get_state(config).values["messages"]
assert [(m.type, m.content) for m in updated_messages[: len(messages)]] == [
    (m.type, m.content) for m in messages
]

Overwrite the original message history¶
Let's now change the pre_model_hook to overwrite the message history in the graph state. To do this, we’ll return the updated messages under messages key. We’ll also include a special RemoveMessage(REMOVE_ALL_MESSAGES) object, which tells create_react_agent to remove previous messages from the graph state:
from langchain_core.messages import RemoveMessage
from langgraph.graph.message import REMOVE_ALL_MESSAGES

def pre_model_hook(state):
    trimmed_messages = trim_messages(
        state["messages"],
        strategy="last",
        token_counter=count_tokens_approximately,
        max_tokens=384,
        start_on="human",
        end_on=("human", "tool"),
    )
    # NOTE that we're now returning the messages under the `messages` key
    # We also remove the existing messages in the history to ensure we're overwriting the history
    return {"messages": [RemoveMessage(REMOVE_ALL_MESSAGES)] + trimmed_messages}

checkpointer = InMemorySaver()
graph = create_react_agent(
    model,
    tools,
    pre_model_hook=pre_model_hook,
    checkpointer=checkpointer,
)

API Reference: RemoveMessage
Now let's run the agent with the same queries as before:
config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "1"}}

inputs = {"messages": [("user", "What's the weather in NYC?")]}
result = graph.invoke(inputs, config=config)

inputs = {"messages": [("user", "What's it known for?")]}
result = graph.invoke(inputs, config=config)
messages = result["messages"]

inputs = {"messages": [("user", "where can i find the best bagel?")]}
print_stream(
    graph.stream(inputs, config=config, stream_mode="updates"),
    output_messages_key="messages",
)

Each of these places has its own unique style and flavor, so it might be worth trying a few to find your personal favorite!

You can see that the pre_model_hook node returned the last 3 messages again. However, this time, the message history is modified in the graph state as well:
updated_messages = graph.get_state(config).values["messages"]
assert (
    # First 2 messages in the new history are the same as last 2 messages in the old
    [(m.type, m.content) for m in updated_messages[:2]]
    == [(m.type, m.content) for m in messages[-2:]]
)

Summarizing message history¶
Finally, let's apply a different strategy for managing message history — summarization. Just as with trimming, you can choose to keep original message history unmodified or overwrite it. The example below will only show the former.
We will use the SummarizationNode from the prebuilt langmem library. Once the message history reaches the token limit, the summarization node will summarize earlier messages to make sure they fit into max_tokens.
from langmem.short_term import SummarizationNode
from langgraph.prebuilt.chat_agent_executor import AgentState
from typing import Any

model = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o")
summarization_model = model.bind(max_tokens=128)

summarization_node = SummarizationNode(
    token_counter=count_tokens_approximately,
    model=summarization_model,
    max_tokens=384,
    max_summary_tokens=128,
    output_messages_key="llm_input_messages",
)

class State(AgentState):
    # NOTE: we're adding this key to keep track of previous summary information
    # to make sure we're not summarizing on every LLM call
    context: dict[str, Any]

checkpointer = InMemorySaver()
graph = create_react_agent(
    model,
    tools,
    pre_model_hook=summarization_node,
    state_schema=State,
    checkpointer=checkpointer,
)

config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "1"}}
inputs = {"messages": [("user", "What's the weather in NYC?")]}

result = graph.invoke(inputs, config=config)

inputs = {"messages": [("user", "What's it known for?")]}
result = graph.invoke(inputs, config=config)

inputs = {"messages": [("user", "where can i find the best bagel?")]}
print_stream(graph.stream(inputs, config=config, stream_mode="updates"))

How to add human-in-the-loop processes to the prebuilt ReAct agent¶

Prerequisites

        This guide assumes familiarity with the following:
        

                    Human-in-the-loop
                

                    Agent Architectures
                

                    Chat Models
                

                    Tools
                

This guide will show how to add human-in-the-loop processes to the prebuilt ReAct agent. Please see this tutorial for how to get started with the prebuilt ReAct agent
You can add a a breakpoint before tools are called by passing interrupt_before=["tools"] to create_react_agent. Note that you need to be using a checkpointer for this to work.
Setup¶
First, let's install the required packages and set our API keys
%%capture --no-stderr
%pip install -U langgraph langchain-openai

import getpass
import os

def _set_env(var: str):
    if not os.environ.get(var):
        os.environ[var] = getpass.getpass(f"{var}: ")

_set_env("OPENAI_API_KEY")

Code¶
# First we initialize the model we want to use.
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

model = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o", temperature=0)

# For this tutorial we will use custom tool that returns pre-defined values for weather in two cities (NYC & SF)
from typing import Literal

from langchain_core.tools import tool

@tool
def get_weather(location: str):
    """Use this to get weather information from a given location."""
    if location.lower() in ["nyc", "new york"]:
        return "It might be cloudy in nyc"
    elif location.lower() in ["sf", "san francisco"]:
        return "It's always sunny in sf"
    else:
        raise AssertionError("Unknown Location")

tools = [get_weather]

# We need a checkpointer to enable human-in-the-loop patterns
from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver

memory = MemorySaver()

# Define the graph

from langgraph.prebuilt import create_react_agent

graph = create_react_agent(
    model, tools=tools, interrupt_before=["tools"], checkpointer=memory
)

API Reference: ChatOpenAI | tool | MemorySaver | create_react_agent
Usage¶
def print_stream(stream):
    """A utility to pretty print the stream."""
    for s in stream:
        message = s["messages"][-1]
        if isinstance(message, tuple):
            print(message)
        else:
            message.pretty_print()

from langchain_core.messages import HumanMessage

config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "42"}}
inputs = {"messages": [("user", "what is the weather in SF, CA?")]}

print_stream(graph.stream(inputs, config, stream_mode="values"))

API Reference: HumanMessage
================================[1m Human Message [0m=================================

what is the weather in SF, CA?

  get_weather (call_YjOKDkgMGgUZUpKIasYk1AdK)
 Call ID: call_YjOKDkgMGgUZUpKIasYk1AdK
  Args:
    location: SF, CA

We can verify that our graph stopped at the right place:
snapshot = graph.get_state(config)
print("Next step: ", snapshot.next)

Next step:  ('tools',)

Now we can either approve or edit the tool call before proceeding to the next node. If we wanted to approve the tool call, we would simply continue streaming the graph with None input. If we wanted to edit the tool call we need to update the state to have the correct tool call, and then after the update has been applied we can continue.
We can try resuming and we will see an error arise:
print_stream(graph.stream(None, config, stream_mode="values"))

==================================[1m Ai Message [0m==================================

This error arose because our tool argument of "San Francisco, CA" is not a location our tool recognizes.
Let's show how we would edit the tool call to search for "San Francisco" instead of "San Francisco, CA" - since our tool as written treats "San Francisco, CA" as an unknown location. We will update the state and then resume streaming the graph and should see no errors arise:
state = graph.get_state(config)

last_message = state.values["messages"][-1]
last_message.tool_calls[0]["args"] = {"location": "San Francisco"}

graph.update_state(config, {"messages": [last_message]})

{'configurable': {'thread_id': '42',
  'checkpoint_ns': '',
  'checkpoint_id': '1ef801d1-5b93-6bb9-8004-a088af1f9cec'}}

=================================[1m Tool Message [0m=================================
Name: get_weather

==================================[1m Ai Message [0m==================================

The weather in San Francisco is currently sunny.

Fantastic! Our graph updated properly to query the weather in San Francisco and got the correct "It's always sunny in sf" response from the tool, and then responded to the user accordingly.

How to create a ReAct agent from scratch¶

Prerequisites
This guide assumes familiarity with the following:

Tool calling agent
Chat Models
Messages
LangGraph Glossary

Using the prebuilt ReAct agent create_react_agent is a great way to get started, but sometimes you might want more control and customization. In those cases, you can create a custom ReAct agent. This guide shows how to implement ReAct agent from scratch using LangGraph.
Setup¶
First, let's install the required packages and set our API keys:
%%capture --no-stderr
%pip install -U langgraph langchain-openai

import getpass
import os

def _set_env(var: str):
    if not os.environ.get(var):
        os.environ[var] = getpass.getpass(f"{var}: ")

_set_env("OPENAI_API_KEY")

Set up LangSmith for better debugging

         Sign up for LangSmith to quickly spot issues and improve the performance of your LangGraph projects. LangSmith lets you use trace data to debug, test, and monitor your LLM aps built with LangGraph — read more about how to get started in the docs. 
     

Create ReAct agent¶
Now that you have installed the required packages and set your environment variables, we can code our ReAct agent!
Define graph state¶
We are going to define the most basic ReAct state in this example, which will just contain a list of messages.
For your specific use case, feel free to add any other state keys that you need.
from typing import (
    Annotated,
    Sequence,
    TypedDict,
)
from langchain_core.messages import BaseMessage
from langgraph.graph.message import add_messages

class AgentState(TypedDict):
    """The state of the agent."""

    # add_messages is a reducer
    # See https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/low_level/#reducers
    messages: Annotated[Sequence[BaseMessage], add_messages]

API Reference: BaseMessage | add_messages
Define model and tools¶
Next, let's define the tools and model we will use for our example.
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from langchain_core.tools import tool

model = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o-mini")

@tool
def get_weather(location: str):
    """Call to get the weather from a specific location."""
    # This is a placeholder for the actual implementation
    # Don't let the LLM know this though 😊
    if any([city in location.lower() for city in ["sf", "san francisco"]]):
        return "It's sunny in San Francisco, but you better look out if you're a Gemini 😈."
    else:
        return f"I am not sure what the weather is in {location}"

tools = [get_weather]

model = model.bind_tools(tools)

API Reference: ChatOpenAI | tool
Define nodes and edges¶
Next let's define our nodes and edges. In our basic ReAct agent there are only two nodes, one for calling the model and one for using tools, however you can modify this basic structure to work better for your use case. The tool node we define here is a simplified version of the prebuilt ToolNode, which has some additional features.
Perhaps you want to add a node for adding structured output or a node for executing some external action (sending an email, adding a calendar event, etc.). Maybe you just want to change the way the call_model node works and how should_continue decides whether to call tools - the possibilities are endless and LangGraph makes it easy to customize this basic structure for your specific use case.
import json
from langchain_core.messages import ToolMessage, SystemMessage
from langchain_core.runnables import RunnableConfig

tools_by_name = {tool.name: tool for tool in tools}

# Define our tool node
def tool_node(state: AgentState):
    outputs = []
    for tool_call in state["messages"][-1].tool_calls:
        tool_result = tools_by_name[tool_call["name"]].invoke(tool_call["args"])
        outputs.append(
            ToolMessage(
                content=json.dumps(tool_result),
                name=tool_call["name"],
                tool_call_id=tool_call["id"],
            )
        )
    return {"messages": outputs}

# Define the node that calls the model
def call_model(
    state: AgentState,
    config: RunnableConfig,
):
    # this is similar to customizing the create_react_agent with 'prompt' parameter, but is more flexible
    system_prompt = SystemMessage(
        "You are a helpful AI assistant, please respond to the users query to the best of your ability!"
    )
    response = model.invoke([system_prompt] + state["messages"], config)
    # We return a list, because this will get added to the existing list
    return {"messages": [response]}

# Define the conditional edge that determines whether to continue or not
def should_continue(state: AgentState):
    messages = state["messages"]
    last_message = messages[-1]
    # If there is no function call, then we finish
    if not last_message.tool_calls:
        return "end"
    # Otherwise if there is, we continue
    else:
        return "continue"

API Reference: ToolMessage | SystemMessage | RunnableConfig
Define the graph¶
Now that we have defined all of our nodes and edges, we can define and compile our graph. Depending on if you have added more nodes or different edges, you will need to edit this to fit your specific use case.
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, END

# Define a new graph
workflow = StateGraph(AgentState)

# Define the two nodes we will cycle between
workflow.add_node("agent", call_model)
workflow.add_node("tools", tool_node)

# Set the entrypoint as `agent`
# This means that this node is the first one called
workflow.set_entry_point("agent")

# We now add a conditional edge
workflow.add_conditional_edges(
    # First, we define the start node. We use `agent`.
    # This means these are the edges taken after the `agent` node is called.
    "agent",
    # Next, we pass in the function that will determine which node is called next.
    should_continue,
    # Finally we pass in a mapping.
    # The keys are strings, and the values are other nodes.
    # END is a special node marking that the graph should finish.
    # What will happen is we will call `should_continue`, and then the output of that
    # will be matched against the keys in this mapping.
    # Based on which one it matches, that node will then be called.
    {
        # If `tools`, then we call the tool node.
        "continue": "tools",
        # Otherwise we finish.
        "end": END,
    },
)

# We now add a normal edge from `tools` to `agent`.
# This means that after `tools` is called, `agent` node is called next.
workflow.add_edge("tools", "agent")

# Now we can compile and visualize our graph
graph = workflow.compile()

from IPython.display import Image, display

try:
    display(Image(graph.get_graph().draw_mermaid_png()))
except Exception:
    # This requires some extra dependencies and is optional
    pass

API Reference: StateGraph | END

Use ReAct agent¶
Now that we have created our react agent, let's actually put it to the test!
# Helper function for formatting the stream nicely
def print_stream(stream):
    for s in stream:
        message = s["messages"][-1]
        if isinstance(message, tuple):
            print(message)
        else:
            message.pretty_print()

inputs = {"messages": [("user", "what is the weather in sf")]}
print_stream(graph.stream(inputs, stream_mode="values"))

================================[1m Human Message [0m=================================

what is the weather in sf
==================================[1m Ai Message [0m==================================
Tool Calls:
  get_weather (call_azW0cQ4XjWWj0IAkWAxq9nLB)
 Call ID: call_azW0cQ4XjWWj0IAkWAxq9nLB

The weather in San Francisco is sunny! However, it seems there's a playful warning for Geminis. Enjoy the sunshine!

Perfect! The graph correctly calls the get_weather tool and responds to the user after receiving the information from the tool.

How to use subgraphs¶

Prerequisites

        This guide assumes familiarity with the following:
        

                    Subgraphs
                

                    State
                

Subgraphs allow you to build complex systems with multiple components that are themselves graphs. A common use case for using subgraphs is building multi-agent systems.
The main question when adding subgraphs is how the parent graph and subgraph communicate, i.e. how they pass the state between each other during the graph execution. There are two scenarios:

parent graph and subgraph share schema keys. In this case, you can add a node with the compiled subgraph
parent graph and subgraph have different schemas. In this case, you have to add a node function that invokes the subgraph: this is useful when the parent graph and the subgraph have different state schemas and you need to transform state before or after calling the subgraph

Below we show to to add subgraphs for each scenario.

Setup¶
First, let's install the required packages
%%capture --no-stderr
%pip install -U langgraph

Set up LangSmith for LangGraph development

        Sign up for LangSmith to quickly spot issues and improve the performance of your LangGraph projects. LangSmith lets you use trace data to debug, test, and monitor your LLM apps built with LangGraph — read more about how to get started here. 
    

Add a node with the compiled subgraph¶
A common case is for the parent graph and subgraph to communicate over a shared state key (channel). For example, in multi-agent systems, the agents often communicate over a shared messages key.
If your subgraph shares state keys with the parent graph, you can follow these steps to add it to your graph:

Define the subgraph workflow (subgraph_builder in the example below) and compile it
Pass compiled subgraph to the .add_node method when defining the parent graph workflow

Let's take a look at a simple example. 
from langgraph.graph import START, StateGraph
from typing import TypedDict

# Define subgraph
class SubgraphState(TypedDict):
    foo: str  # note that this key is shared with the parent graph state
    bar: str

def subgraph_node_1(state: SubgraphState):
    return {"bar": "bar"}

def subgraph_node_2(state: SubgraphState):
    # note that this node is using a state key ('bar') that is only available in the subgraph
    # and is sending update on the shared state key ('foo')
    return {"foo": state["foo"] + state["bar"]}

subgraph_builder = StateGraph(SubgraphState)
subgraph_builder.add_node(subgraph_node_1)
subgraph_builder.add_node(subgraph_node_2)
subgraph_builder.add_edge(START, "subgraph_node_1")
subgraph_builder.add_edge("subgraph_node_1", "subgraph_node_2")
subgraph = subgraph_builder.compile()

# Define parent graph
class ParentState(TypedDict):
    foo: str

def node_1(state: ParentState):
    return {"foo": "hi! " + state["foo"]}

builder = StateGraph(ParentState)
builder.add_node("node_1", node_1)
# note that we're adding the compiled subgraph as a node to the parent graph
builder.add_node("node_2", subgraph)
builder.add_edge(START, "node_1")
builder.add_edge("node_1", "node_2")
graph = builder.compile()

API Reference: START | StateGraph
for chunk in graph.stream({"foo": "foo"}):
    print(chunk)

{'node_1': {'foo': 'hi! foo'}}
{'node_2': {'foo': 'hi! foobar'}}

You can see that the final output from the parent graph includes the results of subgraph invocation (i.e. string "bar"). If you would like to see outputs from the subgraph, you can specify subgraphs=True when streaming. See more on streaming from subgraphs in this how-to guide.
for chunk in graph.stream({"foo": "foo"}, subgraphs=True):
    print(chunk)

((), {'node_1': {'foo': 'hi! foo'}})
(('node_2:e58e5673-a661-ebb0-70d4-e298a7fc28b7',), {'subgraph_node_1': {'bar': 'bar'}})
(('node_2:e58e5673-a661-ebb0-70d4-e298a7fc28b7',), {'subgraph_node_2': {'foo': 'hi! foobar'}})
((), {'node_2': {'foo': 'hi! foobar'}})

Add a node function that invokes the subgraph¶
For more complex systems you might want to define subgraphs that have a completely different schema from the parent graph (no shared keys). For example, in a multi-agent RAG system, a search agent might only need to keep track of queries and retrieved documents.
If that's the case for your application, you need to define a node function that invokes the subgraph. This function needs to transform the input (parent) state to the subgraph state before invoking the subgraph, and transform the results back to the parent state before returning the state update from the node.
Below we show how to modify our original example to call a subgraph from inside the node.

Warning
You cannot invoke more than one subgraph inside the same node.

# Define subgraph
class SubgraphState(TypedDict):
    # note that none of these keys are shared with the parent graph state
    bar: str
    baz: str

def subgraph_node_1(state: SubgraphState):
    return {"baz": "baz"}

def subgraph_node_2(state: SubgraphState):
    return {"bar": state["bar"] + state["baz"]}

subgraph_builder = StateGraph(SubgraphState)
subgraph_builder.add_node(subgraph_node_1)
subgraph_builder.add_node(subgraph_node_2)
subgraph_builder.add_edge(START, "subgraph_node_1")
subgraph_builder.add_edge("subgraph_node_1", "subgraph_node_2")
subgraph = subgraph_builder.compile()

# Define parent graph
class ParentState(TypedDict):
    foo: str

def node_1(state: ParentState):
    return {"foo": "hi! " + state["foo"]}

def node_2(state: ParentState):
    # transform the state to the subgraph state
    response = subgraph.invoke({"bar": state["foo"]})
    # transform response back to the parent state
    return {"foo": response["bar"]}

builder = StateGraph(ParentState)
builder.add_node("node_1", node_1)
# note that instead of using the compiled subgraph we are using `node_2` function that is calling the subgraph
builder.add_node("node_2", node_2)
builder.add_edge(START, "node_1")
builder.add_edge("node_1", "node_2")
graph = builder.compile()

for chunk in graph.stream({"foo": "foo"}, subgraphs=True):
    print(chunk)

((), {'node_1': {'foo': 'hi! foo'}})
(('node_2:c47d7ea3-7798-87c4-adf4-2543a91d6891',), {'subgraph_node_1': {'baz': 'baz'}})
(('node_2:c47d7ea3-7798-87c4-adf4-2543a91d6891',), {'subgraph_node_2': {'bar': 'hi! foobaz'}})
((), {'node_2': {'foo': 'hi! foobaz'}})

How to handle large numbers of tools¶

Prerequisites

        This guide assumes familiarity with the following:
        

                    Tools
                

                    Chat Models
                

                    Embedding Models
                

                    Vectorstores
                

                    Document
                

The subset of available tools to call is generally at the discretion of the model (although many providers also enable the user to specify or constrain the choice of tool). As the number of available tools grows, you may want to limit the scope of the LLM's selection, to decrease token consumption and to help manage sources of error in LLM reasoning.
Here we will demonstrate how to dynamically adjust the tools available to a model. Bottom line up front: like RAG and similar methods, we prefix the model invocation by retrieving over available tools. Although we demonstrate one implementation that searches over tool descriptions, the details of the tool selection can be customized as needed.
Setup¶
First, let's install the required packages and set our API keys
%%capture --no-stderr
%pip install --quiet -U langgraph langchain_openai numpy

import getpass
import os

def _set_env(var: str):
    if not os.environ.get(var):
        os.environ[var] = getpass.getpass(f"{var}: ")

_set_env("OPENAI_API_KEY")

Define the tools¶
Let's consider a toy example in which we have one tool for each publicly traded company in the S&P 500 index. Each tool fetches company-specific information based on the year provided as a parameter.
We first construct a registry that associates a unique identifier with a schema for each tool. We will represent the tools using JSON schema, which can be bound directly to chat models supporting tool calling.
import re
import uuid

from langchain_core.tools import StructuredTool

def create_tool(company: str) -> dict:
    """Create schema for a placeholder tool."""
    # Remove non-alphanumeric characters and replace spaces with underscores for the tool name
    formatted_company = re.sub(r"[^\w\s]", "", company).replace(" ", "_")

    def company_tool(year: int) -> str:
        # Placeholder function returning static revenue information for the company and year
        return f"{company} had revenues of $100 in {year}."

    return StructuredTool.from_function(
        company_tool,
        name=formatted_company,
        description=f"Information about {company}",
    )

# Abbreviated list of S&P 500 companies for demonstration
s_and_p_500_companies = [
    "3M",
    "A.O. Smith",
    "Abbott",
    "Accenture",
    "Advanced Micro Devices",
    "Yum! Brands",
    "Zebra Technologies",
    "Zimmer Biomet",
    "Zoetis",
]

# Create a tool for each company and store it in a registry with a unique UUID as the key
tool_registry = {
    str(uuid.uuid4()): create_tool(company) for company in s_and_p_500_companies
}

API Reference: StructuredTool
Define the graph¶
Tool selection¶
We will construct a node that retrieves a subset of available tools given the information in the state-- such as a recent user message. In general, the full scope of retrieval solutions are available for this step. As a simple solution, we index embeddings of tool descriptions in a vector store, and associate user queries to tools via semantic search.
from langchain_core.documents import Document
from langchain_core.vectorstores import InMemoryVectorStore
from langchain_openai import OpenAIEmbeddings

tool_documents = [
    Document(
        page_content=tool.description,
        id=id,
        metadata={"tool_name": tool.name},
    )
    for id, tool in tool_registry.items()
]

vector_store = InMemoryVectorStore(embedding=OpenAIEmbeddings())
document_ids = vector_store.add_documents(tool_documents)

API Reference: Document | InMemoryVectorStore | OpenAIEmbeddings
Incorporating with an agent¶
We will use a typical React agent graph (e.g., as used in the quickstart), with some modifications:

We add a selected_tools key to the state, which stores our selected subset of tools;
We set the entry point of the graph to be a select_tools node, which populates this element of the state;
We bind the selected subset of tools to the chat model within the agent node.

    selected_tools: list[str]

builder = StateGraph(State)

# Retrieve all available tools from the tool registry.
tools = list(tool_registry.values())
llm = ChatOpenAI()

# The agent function processes the current state
# by binding selected tools to the LLM.
def agent(state: State):
    # Map tool IDs to actual tools
    # based on the state's selected_tools list.
    selected_tools = [tool_registry[id] for id in state["selected_tools"]]
    # Bind the selected tools to the LLM for the current interaction.
    llm_with_tools = llm.bind_tools(selected_tools)
    # Invoke the LLM with the current messages and return the updated message list.
    return {"messages": [llm_with_tools.invoke(state["messages"])]}

# The select_tools function selects tools based on the user's last message content.
def select_tools(state: State):
    last_user_message = state["messages"][-1]
    query = last_user_message.content
    tool_documents = vector_store.similarity_search(query)

In 2022, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) had revenues of $100.

Repeating tool selection¶
To manage errors from incorrect tool selection, we could revisit the select_tools node. One option for implementing this is to modify select_tools to generate the vector store query using all messages in the state (e.g., with a chat model) and add an edge routing from tools to select_tools.
We implement this change below. For demonstration purposes, we simulate an error in the initial tool selection by adding a hack_remove_tool_condition to the select_tools node, which removes the correct tool on the first iteration of the node. Note that on the second iteration, the agent finishes the run as it has access to the correct tool.

Using Pydantic with LangChain

        This notebook uses Pydantic v2 BaseModel, which requires langchain-core >= 0.3. Using langchain-core < 0.3 will result in errors due to mixing of Pydantic v1 and v2 BaseModels.

    as the query. Otherwise, constructs a query using a system message and invokes
    the LLM to generate tool suggestions.

    last_message = state["messages"][-1]
    hack_remove_tool_condition = False  # Simulate an error in the first tool selection

    if isinstance(last_message, HumanMessage):
        query = last_message.content

Next steps¶
This guide provides a minimal implementation for dynamically selecting tools. There is a host of possible improvements and optimizations:

Repeating tool selection: Here, we repeated tool selection by modifying the select_tools node. Another option is to equip the agent with a reselect_tools tool, allowing it to re-select tools at its discretion.
Optimizing tool selection: In general, the full scope of retrieval solutions are available for tool selection. Additional options include:
Group tools and retrieve over groups;
Use a chat model to select tools or groups of tool.

How to update graph state from tools¶

Prerequisites
This guide assumes familiarity with the following:

Command

A common use case is updating graph state from inside a tool. For example, in a customer support application you might want to look up customer account number or ID in the beginning of the conversation. To update the graph state from the tool, you can return Command(update={"my_custom_key": "foo", "messages": [...]}) from the tool:
@tool
def lookup_user_info(tool_call_id: Annotated[str, InjectedToolCallId], config: RunnableConfig):
    """Use this to look up user information to better assist them with their questions."""
    user_info = get_user_info(config)
    return Command(
        update={
            # update the state keys
            "user_info": user_info,
            # update the message history
            "messages": [ToolMessage("Successfully looked up user information", tool_call_id=tool_call_id)]
        }
    )

Important
If you want to use tools that return Command and update graph state, you can either use prebuilt create_react_agent / ToolNode components, or implement your own tool-executing node that collects Command objects returned by the tools and returns a list of them, e.g.:
def call_tools(state):
    ...
    commands = [tools_by_name[tool_call["name"]].invoke(tool_call) for tool_call in tool_calls]
    return commands

This guide shows how you can do this using LangGraph's prebuilt components (create_react_agent / ToolNode).

Note
Support for tools that return Command was added in LangGraph v0.2.59.

Setup¶
First, let's install the required packages and set our API keys:

def _set_if_undefined(var: str):
    if not os.environ.get(var):
        os.environ[var] = getpass.getpass(f"Please provide your {var}")

_set_if_undefined("OPENAI_API_KEY")

Let's create a simple ReAct style agent that can look up user information and personalize the response based on the user info.
Define tool¶
First, let's define the tool that we'll be using to look up user information. We'll use a naive implementation that simply looks user information up using a dictionary:
USER_INFO = [
    {"user_id": "1", "name": "Bob Dylan", "location": "New York, NY"},
    {"user_id": "2", "name": "Taylor Swift", "location": "Beverly Hills, CA"},
]

USER_ID_TO_USER_INFO = {info["user_id"]: info for info in USER_INFO}

from langgraph.prebuilt.chat_agent_executor import AgentState
from langgraph.types import Command
from langchain_core.tools import tool
from langchain_core.tools.base import InjectedToolCallId
from langchain_core.messages import ToolMessage
from langchain_core.runnables import RunnableConfig

from typing_extensions import Any, Annotated

class State(AgentState):
    # updated by the tool
    user_info: dict[str, Any]

@tool
def lookup_user_info(
    tool_call_id: Annotated[str, InjectedToolCallId], config: RunnableConfig
):
    """Use this to look up user information to better assist them with their questions."""
    user_id = config.get("configurable", {}).get("user_id")
    if user_id is None:
        raise ValueError("Please provide user ID")

    if user_id not in USER_ID_TO_USER_INFO:
        raise ValueError(f"User '{user_id}' not found")

    user_info = USER_ID_TO_USER_INFO[user_id]
    return Command(
        update={
            # update the state keys
            "user_info": user_info,
            # update the message history
            "messages": [
                ToolMessage(
                    "Successfully looked up user information", tool_call_id=tool_call_id
                )
            ],
        }
    )

API Reference: Command | tool | InjectedToolCallId | ToolMessage | RunnableConfig
Define prompt¶
Let's now add personalization: we'll respond differently to the user based on the state values AFTER the state has been updated from the tool. To achieve this, let's define a function that will dynamically construct the system prompt based on the graph state. It will be called every time the LLM is called and the function output will be passed to the LLM:
def prompt(state: State):
    user_info = state.get("user_info")
    if user_info is None:
        return state["messages"]

    system_msg = (
        f"User name is {user_info['name']}. User lives in {user_info['location']}"
    )
    return [{"role": "system", "content": system_msg}] + state["messages"]

Define graph¶
Finally, let's combine this into a single graph using the prebuilt create_react_agent:
from langgraph.prebuilt import create_react_agent
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

model = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o")

agent = create_react_agent(
    model,
    # pass the tool that can update state
    [lookup_user_info],
    state_schema=State,
    # pass dynamic prompt function
    prompt=prompt,
)

API Reference: create_react_agent | ChatOpenAI
Use it!¶
Let's now try running our agent. We'll need to provide user ID in the config so that our tool knows what information to look up:
for chunk in agent.stream(
    {"messages": [("user", "hi, what should i do this weekend?")]},
    # provide user ID in the config
    {"configurable": {"user_id": "1"}},
):
    print(chunk)
    print("\n")

How to pass runtime values to tools¶
Sometimes, you want to let a tool-calling LLM populate a subset of the tool functions' arguments and provide the other values for the other arguments at runtime. If you're using LangChain-style tools, an easy way to handle this is by annotating function parameters with InjectedArg. This annotation excludes that parameter from being shown to the LLM.
In LangGraph applications you might want to pass the graph state or shared memory (store) to the tools at runtime. This type of stateful tools is useful when a tool's output is affected by past agent steps (e.g. if you're using a sub-agent as a tool, and want to pass the message history in to the sub-agent), or when a tool's input needs to be validated given context from past agent steps.
In this guide we'll demonstrate how to do so using LangGraph's prebuilt ToolNode.

Prerequisites

        This guide targets **LangChain tool calling** assumes familiarity with the following:
        

                    Tools
                

                    State
                

                    Tool-calling
                

        You can still use tool calling in LangGraph using your provider SDK without losing any of LangGraph's core features.
    

The core technique in the examples below is to annotate a parameter as "injected", meaning it will be injected by your program and should not be seen or populated by the LLM. Let the following codesnippet serve as a tl;dr:
from typing import Annotated

from langchain_core.runnables import RunnableConfig
from langchain_core.tools import InjectedToolArg
from langgraph.store.base import BaseStore

from langgraph.prebuilt import InjectedState, InjectedStore

# Can be sync or async; @tool decorator not required
async def my_tool(
    # These arguments are populated by the LLM
    some_arg: str,
    another_arg: float,
    # The config: RunnableConfig is always available in LangChain calls
    # This is not exposed to the LLM
    config: RunnableConfig,
    # The following three are specific to the prebuilt ToolNode
    # (and `create_react_agent` by extension). If you are invoking the
    # tool on its own (in your own node), then you would need to provide these yourself.
    store: Annotated[BaseStore, InjectedStore],
    # This passes in the full state.
    state: Annotated[State, InjectedState],
    # You can also inject single fields from your state if you
    messages: Annotated[list, InjectedState("messages")]
    # The following is not compatible with create_react_agent or ToolNode
    # You can also exclude other arguments from being shown to the model.
    # These must be provided manually and are useful if you call the tools/functions in your own node
    # some_other_arg=Annotated["MyPrivateClass", InjectedToolArg],
):
    """Call my_tool to have an impact on the real world.

    Args:
        some_arg: a very important argument
        another_arg: another argument the LLM will provide
    """ # The docstring becomes the description for your tool and is passed to the model
    print(some_arg, another_arg, config, store, state, messages)
    # Config, some_other_rag, store, and state  are all "hidden" from
    # LangChain models when passed to bind_tools or with_structured_output
    return "... some response"

API Reference: RunnableConfig | InjectedToolArg | InjectedState

Setup¶
First we need to install the packages required
%%capture --no-stderr
%pip install --quiet -U langgraph langchain-openai

Next, we need to set API keys for OpenAI (the chat model we will use).
import getpass
import os

def _set_env(var: str):
    if not os.environ.get(var):
        os.environ[var] = getpass.getpass(f"{var}: ")

_set_env("OPENAI_API_KEY")

Set up LangSmith for LangGraph development

        Sign up for LangSmith to quickly spot issues and improve the performance of your LangGraph projects. LangSmith lets you use trace data to debug, test, and monitor your LLM apps built with LangGraph — read more about how to get started here. 
    

Pass graph state to tools¶
Let's first take a look at how to give our tools access to the graph state. We'll need to define our graph state:
from typing import List

# this is the state schema used by the prebuilt create_react_agent we'll be using below
from langgraph.prebuilt.chat_agent_executor import AgentState
from langchain_core.documents import Document

class State(AgentState):
    docs: List[str]

API Reference: Document
Define the tools¶
We'll want our tool to take graph state as an input, but we don't want the model to try to generate this input when calling the tool. We can use the InjectedState annotation to mark arguments as required graph state (or some field of graph state. These arguments will not be generated by the model. When using ToolNode, graph state will automatically be passed in to the relevant tools and arguments.
In this example we'll create a tool that returns Documents and then another tool that actually cites the Documents that justify a claim.

Using Pydantic with LangChain

        This notebook uses Pydantic v2 BaseModel, which requires langchain-core >= 0.3. Using langchain-core < 0.3 will result in errors due to mixing of Pydantic v1 and v2 BaseModels.
    

from typing import List, Tuple
from typing_extensions import Annotated

from langchain_core.messages import ToolMessage
from langchain_core.tools import tool
from langgraph.prebuilt import InjectedState

@tool
def get_context(question: str, state: Annotated[dict, InjectedState]):
    """Get relevant context for answering the question."""
    return "\n\n".join(doc for doc in state["docs"])

API Reference: ToolMessage | tool | InjectedState
If we look at the input schemas for these tools, we'll see that state is still listed:
get_context.get_input_schema().schema()

{'description': 'Get relevant context for answering the question.',
 'properties': {'question': {'title': 'Question', 'type': 'string'},
  'state': {'title': 'State', 'type': 'object'}},
 'required': ['question', 'state'],
 'title': 'get_context',
 'type': 'object'}

But if we look at the tool call schema, which is what is passed to the model for tool-calling, state has been removed:
get_context.tool_call_schema.schema()

{'description': 'Get relevant context for answering the question.',
 'properties': {'question': {'title': 'Question', 'type': 'string'}},
 'required': ['question'],
 'title': 'get_context',
 'type': 'object'}

Define the graph¶
In this example we will be using a prebuilt ReAct agent. We'll first need to define our model and a tool-calling node (ToolNode):
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from langgraph.prebuilt import ToolNode, create_react_agent
from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver

model = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o", temperature=0)
tools = [get_context]

# ToolNode will automatically take care of injecting state into tools
tool_node = ToolNode(tools)

checkpointer = MemorySaver()
graph = create_react_agent(model, tools, state_schema=State, checkpointer=checkpointer)

API Reference: ChatOpenAI | ToolNode | create_react_agent | MemorySaver
Use it!¶
docs = [
    "FooBar company just raised 1 Billion dollars!",
    "FooBar company was founded in 2019",
]

inputs = {
    "messages": [{"type": "user", "content": "what's the latest news about FooBar"}],
    "docs": docs,
}
config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "1"}}
for chunk in graph.stream(inputs, config, stream_mode="values"):
    chunk["messages"][-1].pretty_print()

================================[1m Human Message [0m=================================

what's the latest news about FooBar
==================================[1m Ai Message [0m==================================
Tool Calls:
  get_context (call_UkqfR7z2cLJQjhatUpDeEa5H)
 Call ID: call_UkqfR7z2cLJQjhatUpDeEa5H
  Args:
    question: latest news about FooBar
=================================[1m Tool Message [0m=================================
Name: get_context

FooBar company just raised 1 Billion dollars!

FooBar company was founded in 2019
==================================[1m Ai Message [0m==================================

The latest news about FooBar is that the company has just raised 1 billion dollars.

Pass shared memory (store) to the graph¶
You might also want to give tools access to memory that is shared across multiple conversations or users. We can do it by passing LangGraph Store to the tools using a different annotation -- InjectedStore.
Let's modify our example to save the documents in an in-memory store and retrieve them using get_context tool. We'll also make the documents accessible based on a user ID, so that some documents are only visible to certain users. The tool will then use the user_id provided in the config to retrieve a correct set of documents.

Note

        Support for Store API and InjectedStore used in this notebook was added in LangGraph v0.2.34.
        

InjectedStore annotation requires langchain-core >= 0.3.8

from langgraph.store.memory import InMemoryStore

doc_store = InMemoryStore()

namespace = ("documents", "1")  # user ID
doc_store.put(
    namespace, "doc_0", {"doc": "FooBar company just raised 1 Billion dollars!"}
)
namespace = ("documents", "2")  # user ID
doc_store.put(namespace, "doc_1", {"doc": "FooBar company was founded in 2019"})

Define the tools¶
from langgraph.store.base import BaseStore
from langchain_core.runnables import RunnableConfig
from langgraph.prebuilt import InjectedStore

@tool
def get_context(
    question: str,
    config: RunnableConfig,
    store: Annotated[BaseStore, InjectedStore()],
) -> Tuple[str, List[Document]]:
    """Get relevant context for answering the question."""
    user_id = config.get("configurable", {}).get("user_id")
    docs = [item.value["doc"] for item in store.search(("documents", user_id))]
    return "\n\n".join(doc for doc in docs)

API Reference: RunnableConfig
We can also verify that the tool-calling model will ignore store arg of get_context tool:
get_context.tool_call_schema.schema()

{'description': 'Get relevant context for answering the question.',
 'properties': {'question': {'title': 'Question', 'type': 'string'}},
 'required': ['question'],
 'title': 'get_context',
 'type': 'object'}

Define the graph¶
Let's update our ReAct agent:
tools = [get_context]

# ToolNode will automatically take care of injecting Store into tools
tool_node = ToolNode(tools)

checkpointer = MemorySaver()
# NOTE: we need to pass our store to `create_react_agent` to make sure our graph is aware of it
graph = create_react_agent(model, tools, checkpointer=checkpointer, store=doc_store)

Use it!¶
Let's try running our graph with a "user_id" in the config.
messages = [{"type": "user", "content": "what's the latest news about FooBar"}]
config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "1", "user_id": "1"}}
for chunk in graph.stream({"messages": messages}, config, stream_mode="values"):
    chunk["messages"][-1].pretty_print()

================================[1m Human Message [0m=================================

what's the latest news about FooBar
==================================[1m Ai Message [0m==================================
Tool Calls:
  get_context (call_ocyHBpGgF3LPFOgRKURBfkGG)
 Call ID: call_ocyHBpGgF3LPFOgRKURBfkGG
  Args:
    question: latest news about FooBar
=================================[1m Tool Message [0m=================================
Name: get_context

FooBar company just raised 1 Billion dollars!
==================================[1m Ai Message [0m==================================

The latest news about FooBar is that the company has just raised 1 billion dollars.

We can see that the tool only retrieved the correct document for user "1" when looking up the information in the store. Let's now try it again for a different user:
messages = [{"type": "user", "content": "what's the latest news about FooBar"}]
config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "2", "user_id": "2"}}
for chunk in graph.stream({"messages": messages}, config, stream_mode="values"):
    chunk["messages"][-1].pretty_print()

================================[1m Human Message [0m=================================

what's the latest news about FooBar
==================================[1m Ai Message [0m==================================
Tool Calls:
  get_context (call_zxO9KVlL8UxFQUMb8ETeHNvs)
 Call ID: call_zxO9KVlL8UxFQUMb8ETeHNvs
  Args:
    question: latest news about FooBar
=================================[1m Tool Message [0m=================================
Name: get_context

==================================[1m Ai Message [0m==================================

FooBar company was founded in 2019. If you need more specific or recent news, please let me know!

We can see that the tool pulled in a different document this time.

How to pass config to tools¶

Prerequisites

        This guide assumes familiarity with the following:
        

                    Runnable Interface
                

                    Tool calling agent
                

                    Tools
                

                    Streaming
                

                    Chat Models
                

At runtime, you may need to pass values to a tool, like a user ID, which should be set by the application logic, not controlled by the LLM, for security reasons. The LLM should only manage its intended parameters.
LangChain tools use the Runnable interface, where methods like invoke accept runtime information through the config argument with a RunnableConfig type annotation.
In the following example, we’ll set up an agent with tools to manage a user's favorite pets—adding, reading, and deleting entries—while fixing the user ID through application logic and letting the chat model control other parameters
Setup¶
First, let's install the required packages and set our API keys
%%capture --no-stderr
%pip install --quiet -U langgraph langchain_anthropic

import getpass
import os

def _set_env(var: str):
    if not os.environ.get(var):
        os.environ[var] = getpass.getpass(f"{var}: ")

_set_env("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY")

Define tools and model¶

Config type annotations
Each tool function can take a config argument. In order for the config to be correctly propagated to the function, you MUST always add a RunnableConfig type annotation for your config argument. For example:
def my_tool(tool_arg: str, config: RunnableConfig):
    ...

from typing import List

from langchain_core.tools import tool
from langchain_core.runnables.config import RunnableConfig

from langgraph.prebuilt import ToolNode

user_to_pets = {}

@tool(parse_docstring=True)
def update_favorite_pets(
    # NOTE: config arg does not need to be added to docstring, as we don't want it to be included in the function signature attached to the LLM
    pets: List[str],
    config: RunnableConfig,
) -> None:
    """Add the list of favorite pets.

    Args:
        pets: List of favorite pets to set.
    """
    user_id = config.get("configurable", {}).get("user_id")
    user_to_pets[user_id] = pets

@tool
def delete_favorite_pets(config: RunnableConfig) -> None:
    """Delete the list of favorite pets."""
    user_id = config.get("configurable", {}).get("user_id")
    if user_id in user_to_pets:
        del user_to_pets[user_id]

@tool
def list_favorite_pets(config: RunnableConfig) -> None:
    """List favorite pets if asked to."""
    user_id = config.get("configurable", {}).get("user_id")
    return ", ".join(user_to_pets.get(user_id, []))

tools = [update_favorite_pets, delete_favorite_pets, list_favorite_pets]

API Reference: tool | RunnableConfig | ToolNode
We'll be using a small chat model from Anthropic in our example.
from langchain_anthropic import ChatAnthropic
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, MessagesState
from langgraph.prebuilt import ToolNode

model = ChatAnthropic(model="claude-3-5-haiku-latest")

API Reference: ChatAnthropic | StateGraph | ToolNode
ReAct Agent¶
Let's set up a graph implementation of the ReAct agent. This agent takes some query as input, then repeatedly call tools until it has enough information to resolve the query. We'll be using prebuilt create_react_agent and the Anthropic model with tools we just defined. Note: the tools are automatically added to the model via model.bind_tools inside the create_react_agent implementation.
from langgraph.prebuilt import create_react_agent
from IPython.display import Image, display

graph = create_react_agent(model, tools)

try:
    display(Image(graph.get_graph().draw_mermaid_png()))
except Exception:
    # This requires some extra dependencies and is optional
    pass

API Reference: create_react_agent

Use it!¶
from langchain_core.messages import HumanMessage

user_to_pets.clear()  # Clear the state

print(f"User information prior to run: {user_to_pets}")

inputs = {"messages": [HumanMessage(content="my favorite pets are cats and dogs")]}
for chunk in graph.stream(
    inputs, {"configurable": {"user_id": "123"}}, stream_mode="values"
):
    chunk["messages"][-1].pretty_print()

print(f"User information after the run: {user_to_pets}")

How to handle tool calling errors¶

Prerequisites

        This guide assumes familiarity with the following:
        

                    Tool calling
                

                    Deleting messages
                

LLMs aren't perfect at calling tools. The model may try to call a tool that doesn't exist or fail to return arguments that match the requested schema. Strategies like keeping schemas simple, reducing the number of tools you pass at once, and having good names and descriptions can help mitigate this risk, but aren't foolproof.
This guide covers some ways to build error handling into your graphs to mitigate these failure modes.
Setup¶
First, let's install the required packages and set our API keys
%%capture --no-stderr
%pip install --quiet -U langgraph langchain_anthropic

import getpass
import os

def _set_env(var: str):
    if not os.environ.get(var):
        os.environ[var] = getpass.getpass(f"{var}: ")

_set_env("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY")

Set up LangSmith for LangGraph development

        Sign up for LangSmith to quickly spot issues and improve the performance of your LangGraph projects. LangSmith lets you use trace data to debug, test, and monitor your LLM apps built with LangGraph — read more about how to get started here. 
    

Using the prebuilt ToolNode¶
To start, define a mock weather tool that has some hidden restrictions on input queries. The intent here is to simulate a real-world case where a model fails to call a tool correctly:
from langchain_core.tools import tool

@tool
def get_weather(location: str):
    """Call to get the current weather."""
    if location == "san francisco":
        raise ValueError("Input queries must be proper nouns")
    elif location == "San Francisco":
        return "It's 60 degrees and foggy."
    else:
        raise ValueError("Invalid input.")

API Reference: tool
Next, set up a graph implementation of the ReAct agent. This agent takes some query as input, then repeatedly call tools until it has enough information to resolve the query. We'll use the prebuilt ToolNode to execute called tools, and a small, fast model powered by Anthropic:
from typing import Literal

from langchain_anthropic import ChatAnthropic
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, MessagesState, START, END
from langgraph.prebuilt import ToolNode

tool_node = ToolNode([get_weather])

model_with_tools = ChatAnthropic(
    model="claude-3-haiku-20240307", temperature=0
).bind_tools([get_weather])

def should_continue(state: MessagesState):
    messages = state["messages"]
    last_message = messages[-1]
    if last_message.tool_calls:
        return "tools"
    return END

def call_model(state: MessagesState):
    messages = state["messages"]
    response = model_with_tools.invoke(messages)
    return {"messages": [response]}

workflow = StateGraph(MessagesState)

# Define the two nodes we will cycle between
workflow.add_node("agent", call_model)
workflow.add_node("tools", tool_node)

workflow.add_edge(START, "agent")
workflow.add_conditional_edges("agent", should_continue, ["tools", END])
workflow.add_edge("tools", "agent")

app = workflow.compile()

API Reference: ChatAnthropic | StateGraph | START | END | ToolNode
from IPython.display import Image, display

try:
    display(Image(app.get_graph().draw_mermaid_png()))
except Exception:
    # This requires some extra dependencies and is optional
    pass

When you try to call the tool, you can see that the model calls the tool with a bad input, causing the tool to throw an error. The prebuilt ToolNode that executes the tool has some built-in error handling that captures the error and passes it back to the model so that it can try again:
response = app.invoke(
    {"messages": [("human", "what is the weather in san francisco?")]},
)

for message in response["messages"]:
    string_representation = f"{message.type.upper()}: {message.content}\n"
    print(string_representation)

HUMAN: what is the weather in san francisco?

AI: [{'id': 'toolu_01K5tXKVRbETcs7Q8U9PHy96', 'input': {'location': 'san francisco'}, 'name': 'get_weather', 'type': 'tool_use'}]

TOOL: Error: ValueError('Input queries must be proper nouns')
 Please fix your mistakes.

AI: [{'text': 'Apologies, it looks like there was an issue with the weather lookup. Let me try that again with the proper format:', 'type': 'text'}, {'id': 'toolu_01KSCsme3Du2NBazSJQ1af4b', 'input': {'location': 'San Francisco'}, 'name': 'get_weather', 'type': 'tool_use'}]

TOOL: It's 60 degrees and foggy.

AI: The current weather in San Francisco is 60 degrees and foggy.

Custom strategies¶
This is a fine default in many cases, but there are cases where custom fallbacks may be better.
For example, the below tool requires as input a list of elements of a specific length - tricky for a small model! We'll also intentionally avoid pluralizing topic to trick the model into thinking it should pass a string:
from langchain_core.output_parsers import StrOutputParser
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

class HaikuRequest(BaseModel):
    topic: list[str] = Field(
        max_length=3,
        min_length=3,
    )

@tool
def master_haiku_generator(request: HaikuRequest):
    """Generates a haiku based on the provided topics."""
    model = ChatAnthropic(model="claude-3-haiku-20240307", temperature=0)
    chain = model | StrOutputParser()
    topics = ", ".join(request.topic)
    haiku = chain.invoke(f"Write a haiku about {topics}")
    return haiku

tool_node = ToolNode([master_haiku_generator])

model = ChatAnthropic(model="claude-3-haiku-20240307", temperature=0)
model_with_tools = model.bind_tools([master_haiku_generator])

def should_continue(state: MessagesState):
    messages = state["messages"]
    last_message = messages[-1]
    if last_message.tool_calls:
        return "tools"
    return END

def call_model(state: MessagesState):
    messages = state["messages"]
    response = model_with_tools.invoke(messages)
    return {"messages": [response]}

workflow = StateGraph(MessagesState)

# Define the two nodes we will cycle between
workflow.add_node("agent", call_model)
workflow.add_node("tools", tool_node)

workflow.add_edge(START, "agent")
workflow.add_conditional_edges("agent", should_continue, ["tools", END])
workflow.add_edge("tools", "agent")

app = workflow.compile()

response = app.invoke(
    {"messages": [("human", "Write me an incredible haiku about water.")]},
    {"recursion_limit": 10},
)

for message in response["messages"]:
    string_representation = f"{message.type.upper()}: {message.content}\n"
    print(string_representation)

API Reference: StrOutputParser
HUMAN: Write me an incredible haiku about water.

TOOL: Here is a haiku about ocean, rain, and river:

Vast ocean's embrace,
Raindrops caress the river,
Nature's symphony.

AI: I hope this haiku about water captures the essence you were looking for! Let me know if you would like me to generate another one.

We can see that the model takes two tries to get the input correct.
A better strategy might be to trim the failed attempt to reduce distraction, then fall back to a more advanced model. Here's an example. We also use a custom-built node to call our tools instead of the prebuilt ToolNode:
import json

from langchain_core.messages import AIMessage, ToolMessage
from langchain_core.messages.modifier import RemoveMessage

@tool
def master_haiku_generator(request: HaikuRequest):
    """Generates a haiku based on the provided topics."""
    model = ChatAnthropic(model="claude-3-haiku-20240307", temperature=0)
    chain = model | StrOutputParser()
    topics = ", ".join(request.topic)
    haiku = chain.invoke(f"Write a haiku about {topics}")
    return haiku

def call_tool(state: MessagesState):
    tools_by_name = {master_haiku_generator.name: master_haiku_generator}
    messages = state["messages"]
    last_message = messages[-1]
    output_messages = []
    for tool_call in last_message.tool_calls:
        try:
            tool_result = tools_by_name[tool_call["name"]].invoke(tool_call["args"])
            output_messages.append(
                ToolMessage(
                    content=json.dumps(tool_result),
                    name=tool_call["name"],
                    tool_call_id=tool_call["id"],
                )
            )
        except Exception as e:
            # Return the error if the tool call fails
            output_messages.append(
                ToolMessage(
                    content="",
                    name=tool_call["name"],
                    tool_call_id=tool_call["id"],
                    additional_kwargs={"error": e},
                )
            )
    return {"messages": output_messages}

model = ChatAnthropic(model="claude-3-haiku-20240307", temperature=0)
model_with_tools = model.bind_tools([master_haiku_generator])

better_model = ChatAnthropic(model="claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620", temperature=0)

def should_continue(state: MessagesState):
    messages = state["messages"]
    last_message = messages[-1]
    if last_message.tool_calls:
        return "tools"
    return END

def should_fallback(
    state: MessagesState,
) -> Literal["agent", "remove_failed_tool_call_attempt"]:
    messages = state["messages"]
    failed_tool_messages = [
        msg
        for msg in messages
        if isinstance(msg, ToolMessage)
        and msg.additional_kwargs.get("error") is not None
    ]
    if failed_tool_messages:
        return "remove_failed_tool_call_attempt"
    return "agent"

def call_model(state: MessagesState):
    messages = state["messages"]
    response = model_with_tools.invoke(messages)
    return {"messages": [response]}

def remove_failed_tool_call_attempt(state: MessagesState):
    messages = state["messages"]
    # Remove all messages from the most recent
    # instance of AIMessage onwards.
    last_ai_message_index = next(
        i
        for i, msg in reversed(list(enumerate(messages)))
        if isinstance(msg, AIMessage)
    )
    messages_to_remove = messages[last_ai_message_index:]
    return {"messages": [RemoveMessage(id=m.id) for m in messages_to_remove]}

# Fallback to a better model if a tool call fails

workflow.add_conditional_edges("tools", should_fallback)
workflow.add_edge("remove_failed_tool_call_attempt", "fallback_agent")
workflow.add_edge("fallback_agent", "tools")

app = workflow.compile()

API Reference: AIMessage | ToolMessage | RemoveMessage
The tools node will now return ToolMessages with an error field in additional_kwargs if a tool call fails. If that happens, it will go to another node that removes the failed tool messages, and has a better model retry the tool call generation.
The diagram below shows this visually:
try:
    display(Image(app.get_graph().draw_mermaid_png()))
except Exception:
    # This requires some extra dependencies and is optional
    pass

Let's try it out. To emphasize the removal steps, let's stream the responses from the model so that we can see each executed node:
stream = app.stream(
    {"messages": [("human", "Write me an incredible haiku about water.")]},
    {"recursion_limit": 10},
)

for chunk in stream:
    print(chunk)

{'agent': {'messages': [AIMessage(content=[{'text': 'Here is a haiku about water:', 'type': 'text'}, {'id': 'toolu_019mY8NX4t7YkJBWeHG6jE4T', 'input': {'topic': ['water']}, 'name': 'master_haiku_generator', 'type': 'tool_use'}], additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={'id': 'msg_01RmoaLh38DnRX2fv7E8vCFh', 'model': 'claude-3-haiku-20240307', 'stop_reason': 'tool_use', 'stop_sequence': None, 'usage': {'input_tokens': 384, 'output_tokens': 67}}, id='run-a1511215-1a62-49b5-b5b3-b2c8f8c7920e-0', tool_calls=[{'name': 'master_haiku_generator', 'args': {'topic': ['water']}, 'id': 'toolu_019mY8NX4t7YkJBWeHG6jE4T', 'type': 'tool_call'}], usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 384, 'output_tokens': 67, 'total_tokens': 451})]}}

You can see that you get a cleaner response - the more powerful model gets it right on the first try, and the smaller model's failure gets wiped from the graph state. This shorter message history also avoid overpopulating the graph state with attempts.
You can also inspect this LangSmith trace, which shows the failed initial call to the smaller model.
Next steps¶
You've now seen how to implement some strategies to handle tool calling errors.
Next, check out some of the other LangGraph how-to guides here.

CONTENT:
How to call tools using ToolNode¶
This guide covers how to use LangGraph's prebuilt ToolNode for tool calling.
ToolNode is a LangChain Runnable that takes graph state (with a list of messages) as input and outputs state update with the result of tool calls. It is designed to work well out-of-box with LangGraph's prebuilt ReAct agent, but can also work with any StateGraph as long as its state has a messages key with an appropriate reducer (see MessagesState).
Setup¶
First, let's install the required packages and set our API keys
%%capture --no-stderr
%pip install --quiet -U langgraph langchain_anthropic

import getpass
import os

def _set_env(var: str):
    if not os.environ.get(var):
        os.environ[var] = getpass.getpass(f"{var}: ")

_set_env("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY")

        Sign up for LangSmith to quickly spot issues and improve the performance of your LangGraph projects. LangSmith lets you use trace data to debug, test, and monitor your LLM apps built with LangGraph — read more about how to get started here. 
    

Define tools¶
from langchain_core.messages import AIMessage
from langchain_core.tools import tool

from langgraph.prebuilt import ToolNode

API Reference: AIMessage | tool | ToolNode
@tool
def get_weather(location: str):
    """Call to get the current weather."""
    if location.lower() in ["sf", "san francisco"]:
        return "It's 60 degrees and foggy."
    else:
        return "It's 90 degrees and sunny."

@tool
def get_coolest_cities():
    """Get a list of coolest cities"""
    return "nyc, sf"

tools = [get_weather, get_coolest_cities]
tool_node = ToolNode(tools)

Manually call ToolNode¶
ToolNode operates on graph state with a list of messages. It expects the last message in the list to be an AIMessage with tool_calls parameter. 
Let's first see how to invoke the tool node manually:
message_with_single_tool_call = AIMessage(
    content="",
    tool_calls=[
        {
            "name": "get_weather",
            "args": {"location": "sf"},
            "id": "tool_call_id",
            "type": "tool_call",
        }
    ],
)

tool_node.invoke({"messages": [message_with_single_tool_call]})

{'messages': [ToolMessage(content="It's 60 degrees and foggy.", name='get_weather', tool_call_id='tool_call_id')]}

Note that typically you don't need to create AIMessage manually, and it will be automatically generated by any LangChain chat model that supports tool calling.
You can also do parallel tool calling using ToolNode if you pass multiple tool calls to AIMessage's tool_calls parameter:
message_with_multiple_tool_calls = AIMessage(
    content="",
    tool_calls=[
        {
            "name": "get_coolest_cities",
            "args": {},
            "id": "tool_call_id_1",
            "type": "tool_call",
        },
        {
            "name": "get_weather",
            "args": {"location": "sf"},
            "id": "tool_call_id_2",
            "type": "tool_call",
        },
    ],
)

tool_node.invoke({"messages": [message_with_multiple_tool_calls]})

{'messages': [ToolMessage(content='nyc, sf', name='get_coolest_cities', tool_call_id='tool_call_id_1'),
  ToolMessage(content="It's 60 degrees and foggy.", name='get_weather', tool_call_id='tool_call_id_2')]}

Using with chat models¶
We'll be using a small chat model from Anthropic in our example. To use chat models with tool calling, we need to first ensure that the model is aware of the available tools. We do this by calling .bind_tools method on ChatAnthropic model
from typing import Literal

from langchain_anthropic import ChatAnthropic
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, MessagesState
from langgraph.prebuilt import ToolNode

model_with_tools = ChatAnthropic(
    model="claude-3-haiku-20240307", temperature=0
).bind_tools(tools)

API Reference: ChatAnthropic | StateGraph | ToolNode
model_with_tools.invoke("what's the weather in sf?").tool_calls

[{'name': 'get_weather',
  'args': {'location': 'San Francisco'},
  'id': 'toolu_01Fwm7dg1mcJU43Fkx2pqgm8',
  'type': 'tool_call'}]

As you can see, the AI message generated by the chat model already has tool_calls populated, so we can just pass it directly to ToolNode
tool_node.invoke({"messages": [model_with_tools.invoke("what's the weather in sf?")]})

{'messages': [ToolMessage(content="It's 60 degrees and foggy.", name='get_weather', tool_call_id='toolu_01LFvAVT3xJMeZS6kbWwBGZK')]}

ReAct Agent¶
Next, let's see how to use ToolNode inside a LangGraph graph. Let's set up a graph implementation of the ReAct agent. This agent takes some query as input, then repeatedly call tools until it has enough information to resolve the query. We'll be using ToolNode and the Anthropic model with tools we just defined
from typing import Literal

from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, MessagesState, START, END

def should_continue(state: MessagesState):
    messages = state["messages"]
    last_message = messages[-1]
    if last_message.tool_calls:
        return "tools"
    return END

def call_model(state: MessagesState):
    messages = state["messages"]
    response = model_with_tools.invoke(messages)
    return {"messages": [response]}

workflow = StateGraph(MessagesState)

# Define the two nodes we will cycle between
workflow.add_node("agent", call_model)
workflow.add_node("tools", tool_node)

workflow.add_edge(START, "agent")
workflow.add_conditional_edges("agent", should_continue, ["tools", END])
workflow.add_edge("tools", "agent")

app = workflow.compile()

API Reference: StateGraph | START | END
from IPython.display import Image, display

try:
    display(Image(app.get_graph().draw_mermaid_png()))
except Exception:
    # This requires some extra dependencies and is optional
    pass

Let's try it out!
# example with a single tool call
for chunk in app.stream(
    {"messages": [("human", "what's the weather in sf?")]}, stream_mode="values"

    chunk["messages"][-1].pretty_print()

Based on the results, it looks like the weather in the coolest cities is:
- New York City: 90 degrees and sunny
- San Francisco: 60 degrees and foggy

So the weather in the coolest cities is a mix of warm and cool temperatures, with some sunny and some foggy conditions.

ToolNode can also handle errors during tool execution. You can enable / disable this by setting handle_tool_errors=True (enabled by default). See our guide on handling errors in ToolNode here

How to transform inputs and outputs of a subgraph¶
It's possible that your subgraph state is completely independent from the parent graph state, i.e. there are no overlapping channels (keys) between the two. For example, you might have a supervisor agent that needs to produce a report with a help of multiple ReAct agents. ReAct agent subgraphs might keep track of a list of messages whereas the supervisor only needs user input and final report in its state, and doesn't need to keep track of messages.
In such cases you need to transform the inputs to the subgraph before calling it and then transform its outputs before returning. This guide shows how to do that.
Setup¶
First, let's install the required packages
%%capture --no-stderr
%pip install -U langgraph

Set up LangSmith for LangGraph development

        Sign up for LangSmith to quickly spot issues and improve the performance of your LangGraph projects. LangSmith lets you use trace data to debug, test, and monitor your LLM apps built with LangGraph — read more about how to get started here. 
    

Define graph and subgraphs¶
Let's define 3 graphs:
- a parent graph
- a child subgraph that will be called by the parent graph
- a grandchild subgraph that will be called by the child graph
Define grandchild¶
from typing_extensions import TypedDict
from langgraph.graph.state import StateGraph, START, END

class GrandChildState(TypedDict):
    my_grandchild_key: str

def grandchild_1(state: GrandChildState) -> GrandChildState:
    # NOTE: child or parent keys will not be accessible here
    return {"my_grandchild_key": state["my_grandchild_key"] + ", how are you"}

grandchild = StateGraph(GrandChildState)
grandchild.add_node("grandchild_1", grandchild_1)

grandchild.add_edge(START, "grandchild_1")
grandchild.add_edge("grandchild_1", END)

grandchild_graph = grandchild.compile()

API Reference: StateGraph
grandchild_graph.invoke({"my_grandchild_key": "hi Bob"})

{'my_grandchild_key': 'hi Bob, how are you'}

Define child¶
class ChildState(TypedDict):
    my_child_key: str

def call_grandchild_graph(state: ChildState) -> ChildState:
    # NOTE: parent or grandchild keys won't be accessible here
    # we're transforming the state from the child state channels (`my_child_key`)
    # to the child state channels (`my_grandchild_key`)
    grandchild_graph_input = {"my_grandchild_key": state["my_child_key"]}
    # we're transforming the state from the grandchild state channels (`my_grandchild_key`)
    # back to the child state channels (`my_child_key`)
    grandchild_graph_output = grandchild_graph.invoke(grandchild_graph_input)
    return {"my_child_key": grandchild_graph_output["my_grandchild_key"] + " today?"}

child = StateGraph(ChildState)
# NOTE: we're passing a function here instead of just compiled graph (`child_graph`)
child.add_node("child_1", call_grandchild_graph)
child.add_edge(START, "child_1")
child.add_edge("child_1", END)
child_graph = child.compile()

child_graph.invoke({"my_child_key": "hi Bob"})

{'my_child_key': 'hi Bob, how are you today?'}

Note

    We're wrapping the grandchild_graph invocation in a separate function (call_grandchild_graph) that transforms the input state before calling the grandchild graph and then transforms the output of grandchild graph back to child graph state. If you just pass grandchild_graph directly to .add_node without the transformations, LangGraph will raise an error as there are no shared state channels (keys) between child and grandchild states.
    

Note that child and grandchild subgraphs have their own, independent state that is not shared with the parent graph.
Define parent¶
class ParentState(TypedDict):
    my_key: str

def parent_1(state: ParentState) -> ParentState:
    # NOTE: child or grandchild keys won't be accessible here
    return {"my_key": "hi " + state["my_key"]}

def parent_2(state: ParentState) -> ParentState:
    return {"my_key": state["my_key"] + " bye!"}

def call_child_graph(state: ParentState) -> ParentState:
    # we're transforming the state from the parent state channels (`my_key`)
    # to the child state channels (`my_child_key`)
    child_graph_input = {"my_child_key": state["my_key"]}
    # we're transforming the state from the child state channels (`my_child_key`)
    # back to the parent state channels (`my_key`)
    child_graph_output = child_graph.invoke(child_graph_input)
    return {"my_key": child_graph_output["my_child_key"]}

parent = StateGraph(ParentState)
parent.add_node("parent_1", parent_1)
# NOTE: we're passing a function here instead of just a compiled graph (`<code>child_graph</code>`)
parent.add_node("child", call_child_graph)
parent.add_node("parent_2", parent_2)

parent.add_edge(START, "parent_1")
parent.add_edge("parent_1", "child")
parent.add_edge("child", "parent_2")
parent.add_edge("parent_2", END)

parent_graph = parent.compile()

Note

    We're wrapping the child_graph invocation in a separate function (call_child_graph) that transforms the input state before calling the child graph and then transforms the output of the child graph back to parent graph state. If you just pass child_graph directly to .add_node without the transformations, LangGraph will raise an error as there are no shared state channels (keys) between parent and child states.
    

Let's run the parent graph and make sure it correctly calls both the child and grandchild subgraphs:
parent_graph.invoke({"my_key": "Bob"})

{'my_key': 'hi Bob, how are you today? bye!'}

Perfect! The parent graph correctly calls both the child and grandchild subgraphs (which we know since the ", how are you" and "today?" are added to our original "my_key" state value).

How to implement handoffs between agents¶

Prerequisites
This guide assumes familiarity with the following:

Multi-agent systems
Command
LangGraph Glossary

In multi-agent architectures, agents can be represented as graph nodes. Each agent node executes its step(s) and decides whether to finish execution or route to another agent, including potentially routing to itself (e.g., running in a loop). A natural pattern in multi-agent interactions is handoffs, where one agent hands off control to another. Handoffs allow you to specify:

destination: target agent to navigate to - node name in LangGraph
payload: information to pass to that agent - state update in LangGraph

To implement handoffs in LangGraph, agent nodes can return Command object that allows you to combine both control flow and state updates:
def agent(state) -> Command[Literal["agent", "another_agent"]]:
    # the condition for routing/halting can be anything, e.g. LLM tool call / structured output, etc.
    goto = get_next_agent(...)  # 'agent' / 'another_agent'
    return Command(
        # Specify which agent to call next
        goto=goto,
        # Update the graph state
        update={"my_state_key": "my_state_value"}
    )

One of the most common agent types is a tool-calling agent. For those types of agents, one pattern is wrapping a handoff in a tool call, e.g.:
@tool
def transfer_to_bob(state):
    """Transfer to bob."""
    return Command(
        goto="bob",
        update={"my_state_key": "my_state_value"},
        # Each tool-calling agent is implemented as a subgraph.
        # As a result, to navigate to another agent (a sibling sub-graph), 
        # we need to specify that navigation is w/ respect to the parent graph.
        graph=Command.PARENT,
    )

This guide shows how you can:

implement handoffs using Command: agent node makes a decision on who to hand off to (usually LLM-based), and explicitly returns a handoff via Command. These are useful when you need fine-grained control over how an agent routes to another agent. It could be well suited for implementing a supervisor agent in a supervisor architecture.
implement handoffs using tools: a tool-calling agent has access to tools that can return a handoff via Command. The tool-executing node in the agent recognizes Command objects returned by the tools and routes accordingly. Handoff tool a general-purpose primitive that is useful in any multi-agent systems that contain tool-calling agents.

Setup¶
%%capture --no-stderr
%pip install -U langgraph langchain-anthropic

import getpass
import os

def _set_env(var: str):
    if not os.environ.get(var):
        os.environ[var] = getpass.getpass(f"{var}: ")

_set_env("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY")

Implement handoffs using Command¶
Let's implement a system with two agents:

an addition expert (can only add numbers)
a multiplication expert (can only multiply numbers).

In this example the agents will be relying on the LLM for doing math. In a more realistic follow-up example, we will give the agents tools for doing math.
When the addition expert needs help with multiplication, it hands off to the multiplication expert and vice-versa. This is an example of a simple multi-agent network.
Each agent will have a corresponding node function that can conditionally return a Command object (e.g. our handoff). The node function will use an LLM with a system prompt and a tool that lets it signal when it needs to hand off to another agent. If the LLM responds with the tool calls, we will return a Command(goto=<other_agent>).

Note: while we're using tools for the LLM to signal that it needs a handoff, the condition for the handoff can be anything: a specific response text from the LLM, structured output from the LLM, any other custom logic, etc.

from typing_extensions import Literal
from langchain_core.messages import ToolMessage
from langchain_core.tools import tool
from langchain_anthropic import ChatAnthropic
from langgraph.graph import MessagesState, StateGraph, START
from langgraph.types import Command

model = ChatAnthropic(model="claude-3-5-sonnet-latest")

@tool
def transfer_to_multiplication_expert():
    """Ask multiplication agent for help."""
    # This tool is not returning anything: we're just using it
    # as a way for LLM to signal that it needs to hand off to another agent
    # (See the paragraph above)
    return

@tool
def transfer_to_addition_expert():
    """Ask addition agent for help."""
    return

def addition_expert(
    state: MessagesState,
) -> Command[Literal["multiplication_expert", "__end__"]]:
    system_prompt = (
        "You are an addition expert, you can ask the multiplication expert for help with multiplication. "
        "Always do your portion of calculation before the handoff."
    )
    messages = [{"role": "system", "content": system_prompt}] + state["messages"]
    ai_msg = model.bind_tools([transfer_to_multiplication_expert]).invoke(messages)
    # If there are tool calls, the LLM needs to hand off to another agent
    if len(ai_msg.tool_calls) > 0:
        tool_call_id = ai_msg.tool_calls[-1]["id"]
        # NOTE: it's important to insert a tool message here because LLM providers are expecting
        # all AI messages to be followed by a corresponding tool result message
        tool_msg = {
            "role": "tool",
            "content": "Successfully transferred",
            "tool_call_id": tool_call_id,
        }
        return Command(
            goto="multiplication_expert", update={"messages": [ai_msg, tool_msg]}
        )

    # If the expert has an answer, return it directly to the user
    return {"messages": [ai_msg]}

def multiplication_expert(
    state: MessagesState,
) -> Command[Literal["addition_expert", "__end__"]]:
    system_prompt = (
        "You are a multiplication expert, you can ask an addition expert for help with addition. "
        "Always do your portion of calculation before the handoff."
    )
    messages = [{"role": "system", "content": system_prompt}] + state["messages"]
    ai_msg = model.bind_tools([transfer_to_addition_expert]).invoke(messages)
    if len(ai_msg.tool_calls) > 0:
        tool_call_id = ai_msg.tool_calls[-1]["id"]
        tool_msg = {
            "role": "tool",
            "content": "Successfully transferred",
            "tool_call_id": tool_call_id,
        }
        return Command(goto="addition_expert", update={"messages": [ai_msg, tool_msg]})

    return {"messages": [ai_msg]}

API Reference: ToolMessage | tool | ChatAnthropic | StateGraph | START | Command
Let's now combine both of these nodes into a single graph. Note that there are no edges between the agents! If the expert has an answer, it will return it directly to the user, otherwise it will route to the other expert for help.
builder = StateGraph(MessagesState)
builder.add_node("addition_expert", addition_expert)
builder.add_node("multiplication_expert", multiplication_expert)
# we'll always start with the addition expert
builder.add_edge(START, "addition_expert")
graph = builder.compile()

Finally, let's define a helper function to render the streamed outputs nicely:
from langchain_core.messages import convert_to_messages

def pretty_print_messages(update):
    if isinstance(update, tuple):
        ns, update = update
        # skip parent graph updates in the printouts
        if len(ns) == 0:
            return

        graph_id = ns[-1].split(":")[0]
        print(f"Update from subgraph {graph_id}:")
        print("\n")

    for node_name, node_update in update.items():
        print(f"Update from node {node_name}:")
        print("\n")

        for m in convert_to_messages(node_update["messages"]):
            m.pretty_print()
        print("\n")

API Reference: convert_to_messages
Let's run the graph with an expression that requires both addition and multiplication:
for chunk in graph.stream(
    {"messages": [("user", "what's (3 + 5) * 12")]},
):
    pretty_print_messages(chunk)

Update from node addition_expert:

==================================[1m Ai Message [0m==================================

[{'text': "Let me help break this down:\n\nFirst, I'll handle the addition part since I'm the addition expert:\n3 + 5 = 8\n\nNow, for the multiplication of 8 * 12, I'll need to ask the multiplication expert for help.", 'type': 'text'}, {'id': 'toolu_015LCrsomHbeoQPtCzuff78Y', 'input': {}, 'name': 'transfer_to_multiplication_expert', 'type': 'tool_use'}]
Tool Calls:
  transfer_to_multiplication_expert (toolu_015LCrsomHbeoQPtCzuff78Y)
 Call ID: toolu_015LCrsomHbeoQPtCzuff78Y
  Args:
=================================[1m Tool Message [0m=================================

Successfully transferred

Update from node multiplication_expert:

==================================[1m Ai Message [0m==================================

[{'text': 'I see there was an error in my approach. I am actually the multiplication expert, and I need to ask the addition expert for help with (3 + 5) first.', 'type': 'text'}, {'id': 'toolu_01HFcB8WesPfDyrdgxoXApZk', 'input': {}, 'name': 'transfer_to_addition_expert', 'type': 'tool_use'}]
Tool Calls:
  transfer_to_addition_expert (toolu_01HFcB8WesPfDyrdgxoXApZk)
 Call ID: toolu_01HFcB8WesPfDyrdgxoXApZk
  Args:
=================================[1m Tool Message [0m=================================

Successfully transferred

Update from node addition_expert:

==================================[1m Ai Message [0m==================================

Now that I have the result of 3 + 5 = 8 from the addition expert, I can multiply 8 * 12:

8 * 12 = 96

So, (3 + 5) * 12 = 96

You can see that the addition expert first handled the expression in the parentheses, and then handed off to the multiplication expert to finish the calculation.
Now let's see how we can implement this same system using special handoff tools and give our agents actual math tools.
Implement handoffs using tools¶
Implement a handoff tool¶
In the previous example we explicitly defined custom handoffs in each of the agent nodes. Another pattern is to create special handoff tools that directly return Command objects. When an agent calls a tool like this, it hands the control off to a different agent. Specifically, the tool-executing node in the agent recognizes the Command objects returned by the tools and routes control flow accordingly. Note: unlike the previous example, a tool-calling agent is not a single node but another graph that can be added to the multi-agent graph as a subgraph node.
There are a few important considerations when implementing handoff tools:

since each agent is a subgraph node in another graph, and the tools will be called in one of the agent subgraph nodes (e.g. tool executor), we need to specify graph=Command.PARENT in the Command, so that LangGraph knows to navigate outside of the agent subgraph

we can optionally specify a state update that will be applied to the parent graph state before the next agent is called

these state updates can be used to control how much of the chat message history the target agent sees. For example, you might choose to just share the last AI messages from the current agent, or its full internal chat history, etc. In the examples below we'll be sharing the full internal chat history.

we can optionally provide the following to the tool (in the tool function signature):

graph state (using InjectedState)
graph long-term memory (using InjectedStore)
the current tool call ID (using InjectedToolCallId)

These are not necessary but are useful for creating the state update passed to the next agent.

from typing import Annotated

from langchain_core.tools import tool
from langchain_core.tools.base import InjectedToolCallId
from langgraph.prebuilt import InjectedState

def make_handoff_tool(*, agent_name: str):
    """Create a tool that can return handoff via a Command"""
    tool_name = f"transfer_to_{agent_name}"

Using with a custom agent¶
To demonstrate how to use handoff tools, let's first implement a simple version of the prebuilt create_react_agent. This is useful in case you want to have a custom tool-calling agent implementation and want to leverage handoff tools.
from typing_extensions import Literal
from langchain_core.messages import ToolMessage
from langchain_core.tools import tool
from langgraph.graph import MessagesState, StateGraph, START
from langgraph.types import Command

def make_agent(model, tools, system_prompt=None):
    model_with_tools = model.bind_tools(tools)
    tools_by_name = {tool.name: tool for tool in tools}

    def call_model(state: MessagesState) -> Command[Literal["call_tools", "__end__"]]:
        messages = state["messages"]
        if system_prompt:
            messages = [{"role": "system", "content": system_prompt}] + messages

        response = model_with_tools.invoke(messages)
        if len(response.tool_calls) > 0:
            return Command(goto="call_tools", update={"messages": [response]})

        return {"messages": [response]}

    # NOTE: this is a simplified version of the prebuilt ToolNode
    # If you want to have a tool node that has full feature parity, please refer to the source code
    def call_tools(state: MessagesState) -> Command[Literal["call_model"]]:
        tool_calls = state["messages"][-1].tool_calls
        results = []
        for tool_call in tool_calls:
            tool_ = tools_by_name[tool_call["name"]]
            tool_input_fields = tool_.get_input_schema().model_json_schema()[
                "properties"
            ]

            # this is simplified for demonstration purposes and
            # is different from the ToolNode implementation
            if "state" in tool_input_fields:
                # inject state
                tool_call = {**tool_call, "args": {**tool_call["args"], "state": state}}

            tool_response = tool_.invoke(tool_call)
            if isinstance(tool_response, ToolMessage):
                results.append(Command(update={"messages": [tool_response]}))

            # handle tools that return Command directly
            elif isinstance(tool_response, Command):
                results.append(tool_response)

        # NOTE: nodes in LangGraph allow you to return list of updates, including Command objects
        return results

    graph = StateGraph(MessagesState)
    graph.add_node(call_model)
    graph.add_node(call_tools)
    graph.add_edge(START, "call_model")
    graph.add_edge("call_tools", "call_model")

    return graph.compile()

API Reference: ToolMessage | tool | StateGraph | START | Command
Let's also define math tools that we'll give our agents:
@tool
def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """Adds two numbers."""
    return a + b

@tool
def multiply(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """Multiplies two numbers."""
    return a * b

Let's test the agent implementation out to make sure it's working as expected:
agent = make_agent(model, [add, multiply])

for chunk in agent.stream({"messages": [("user", "what's (3 + 5) * 12")]}):
    pretty_print_messages(chunk)

Update from node call_model:

Update from node call_model:

==================================[1m Ai Message [0m==================================

The result of (3 + 5) * 12 = 96

Now, we can implement our multi-agent system with the multiplication and addition expert agents. This time we'll give them the tools for doing math, as well as our special handoff tools:
addition_expert = make_agent(
    model,
    [add, make_handoff_tool(agent_name="multiplication_expert")],
    system_prompt="You are an addition expert, you can ask the multiplication expert for help with multiplication.",
)
multiplication_expert = make_agent(
    model,
    [multiply, make_handoff_tool(agent_name="addition_expert")],
    system_prompt="You are a multiplication expert, you can ask an addition expert for help with addition.",
)

builder = StateGraph(MessagesState)
builder.add_node("addition_expert", addition_expert)
builder.add_node("multiplication_expert", multiplication_expert)
builder.add_edge(START, "addition_expert")
graph = builder.compile()

Let's run the graph with the same multi-step calculation input as before:
for chunk in graph.stream(
    {"messages": [("user", "what's (3 + 5) * 12")]}, subgraphs=True
):
    pretty_print_messages(chunk)

Update from subgraph addition_expert:

Update from subgraph multiplication_expert:

Update from node call_model:

==================================[1m Ai Message [0m==================================

The final result is 96.

To break down the steps:
1. 3 + 5 = 8
2. 8 * 12 = 96

We can see that after the addition expert is done with the first part of the calculation (after calling the add tool), it decides to hand off to the multiplication expert, which computes the final result.
Using with a prebuilt ReAct agent¶
If you don't need extra customization, you can use the prebuilt create_react_agent, which includes built-in support for handoff tools through ToolNode.
from langgraph.prebuilt import create_react_agent

addition_expert = create_react_agent(
    model,
    [add, make_handoff_tool(agent_name="multiplication_expert")],
    prompt="You are an addition expert, you can ask the multiplication expert for help with multiplication.",
)

multiplication_expert = create_react_agent(
    model,
    [multiply, make_handoff_tool(agent_name="addition_expert")],
    prompt="You are a multiplication expert, you can ask an addition expert for help with addition.",
)

builder = StateGraph(MessagesState)
builder.add_node("addition_expert", addition_expert)
builder.add_node("multiplication_expert", multiplication_expert)
builder.add_edge(START, "addition_expert")
graph = builder.compile()

API Reference: create_react_agent
We can now verify that the prebuilt ReAct agent works exactly the same as the custom agent above:
for chunk in graph.stream(
    {"messages": [("user", "what's (3 + 5) * 12")]}, subgraphs=True
):
    pretty_print_messages(chunk)

Update from subgraph addition_expert:

How to combine control flow and state updates with Command¶

Prerequisites
This guide assumes familiarity with the following:

State
Nodes
Edges
Command

It can be useful to combine control flow (edges) and state updates (nodes). For example, you might want to BOTH perform state updates AND decide which node to go to next in the SAME node. LangGraph provides a way to do so by returning a Command object from node functions:
def my_node(state: State) -> Command[Literal["my_other_node"]]:
    return Command(
        # state update
        update={"foo": "bar"},
        # control flow
        goto="my_other_node"
    )

If you are using subgraphs, you might want to navigate from a node within a subgraph to a different subgraph (i.e. a different node in the parent graph). To do so, you can specify graph=Command.PARENT in Command:
def my_node(state: State) -> Command[Literal["my_other_node"]]:
    return Command(
        update={"foo": "bar"},
        goto="other_subgraph",  # where `other_subgraph` is a node in the parent graph
        graph=Command.PARENT
    )

State updates with Command.PARENT
When you send updates from a subgraph node to a parent graph node for a key that's shared by both parent and subgraph state schemas, you must define a reducer for the key you're updating in the parent graph state. See this example below.

This guide shows how you can do use Command to add dynamic control flow in your LangGraph app.
Setup¶
First, let's install the required packages
%%capture --no-stderr
%pip install -U langgraph

Set up LangSmith for LangGraph development

        Sign up for LangSmith to quickly spot issues and improve the performance of your LangGraph projects. LangSmith lets you use trace data to debug, test, and monitor your LLM apps built with LangGraph — read more about how to get started here. 
    

Let's create a simple graph with 3 nodes: A, B and C. We will first execute node A, and then decide whether to go to Node B or Node C next based on the output of node A.
Basic usage¶
import random
from typing_extensions import TypedDict, Literal

from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START
from langgraph.types import Command

# Define graph state
class State(TypedDict):
    foo: str

# Define the nodes

def node_a(state: State) -> Command[Literal["node_b", "node_c"]]:
    print("Called A")
    value = random.choice(["a", "b"])
    # this is a replacement for a conditional edge function
    if value == "a":
        goto = "node_b"
    else:
        goto = "node_c"

    # note how Command allows you to BOTH update the graph state AND route to the next node
    return Command(
        # this is the state update
        update={"foo": value},
        # this is a replacement for an edge
        goto=goto,
    )

def node_b(state: State):
    print("Called B")
    return {"foo": state["foo"] + "b"}

def node_c(state: State):
    print("Called C")
    return {"foo": state["foo"] + "c"}

API Reference: StateGraph | START | Command
We can now create the StateGraph with the above nodes. Notice that the graph doesn't have conditional edges for routing! This is because control flow is defined with Command inside node_a.
builder = StateGraph(State)
builder.add_edge(START, "node_a")
builder.add_node(node_a)
builder.add_node(node_b)
builder.add_node(node_c)
# NOTE: there are no edges between nodes A, B and C!

graph = builder.compile()

Important
You might have noticed that we used Command as a return type annotation, e.g. Command[Literal["node_b", "node_c"]]. This is necessary for the graph rendering and tells LangGraph that node_a can navigate to node_b and node_c.

from IPython.display import display, Image

display(Image(graph.get_graph().draw_mermaid_png()))

If we run the graph multiple times, we'd see it take different paths (A -> B or A -> C) based on the random choice in node A.
graph.invoke({"foo": ""})

Called A
Called C

{'foo': 'bc'}

Navigating to a node in a parent graph¶
Now let's demonstrate how you can navigate from inside a subgraph to a different node in a parent graph. We'll do so by changing node_a in the above example into a single-node graph that we'll add as a subgraph to our parent graph.

State updates with Command.PARENT
When you send updates from a subgraph node to a parent graph node for a key that's shared by both parent and subgraph state schemas, you must define a reducer for the key you're updating in the parent graph state.

import operator
from typing_extensions import Annotated

class State(TypedDict):
    # NOTE: we define a reducer here
    foo: Annotated[str, operator.add]

def node_a(state: State):
    print("Called A")
    value = random.choice(["a", "b"])
    # this is a replacement for a conditional edge function
    if value == "a":
        goto = "node_b"
    else:
        goto = "node_c"

    # note how Command allows you to BOTH update the graph state AND route to the next node
    return Command(
        update={"foo": value},
        goto=goto,
        # this tells LangGraph to navigate to node_b or node_c in the parent graph
        # NOTE: this will navigate to the closest parent graph relative to the subgraph
        graph=Command.PARENT,
    )

subgraph = StateGraph(State).add_node(node_a).add_edge(START, "node_a").compile()

def node_b(state: State):
    print("Called B")
    # NOTE: since we've defined a reducer, we don't need to manually append
    # new characters to existing 'foo' value. instead, reducer will append these
    # automatically (via operator.add)
    return {"foo": "b"}

def node_c(state: State):
    print("Called C")
    return {"foo": "c"}

builder = StateGraph(State)
builder.add_edge(START, "subgraph")
builder.add_node("subgraph", subgraph)
builder.add_node(node_b)
builder.add_node(node_c)

graph = builder.compile()

graph.invoke({"foo": ""})

Called A
Called C

{'foo': 'bc'}

How to build a multi-agent network (functional API)¶

Prerequisites
This guide assumes familiarity with the following:

Multi-agent systems
Functional API
Command
LangGraph Glossary

In this how-to guide we will demonstrate how to implement a multi-agent network architecture where each agent can communicate with every other agent (many-to-many connections) and can decide which agent to call next. We will be using functional API — individual agents will be defined as tasks and the agent handoffs will be defined in the main entrypoint():
from langgraph.func import entrypoint
from langgraph.prebuilt import create_react_agent
from langchain_core.tools import tool

# Define a tool to signal intent to hand off to a different agent
@tool(return_direct=True)
def transfer_to_hotel_advisor():
    """Ask hotel advisor agent for help."""
    return "Successfully transferred to hotel advisor"

# define an agent
travel_advisor_tools = [transfer_to_hotel_advisor, ...]
travel_advisor = create_react_agent(model, travel_advisor_tools)

# define a task that calls an agent
@task
def call_travel_advisor(messages):
    response = travel_advisor.invoke({"messages": messages})
    return response["messages"]

# define the multi-agent network workflow
@entrypoint()
def workflow(messages):
    call_active_agent = call_travel_advisor
    while True:
        agent_messages = call_active_agent(messages).result()
        messages = messages + agent_messages
        call_active_agent = get_next_agent(messages)
    return messages

API Reference: entrypoint | create_react_agent | tool

First, let's install the required packages

%pip install -U langgraph langchain-anthropic

import getpass
import os

def _set_env(var: str):
    if not os.environ.get(var):

Travel agent example¶
In this example we will build a team of travel assistant agents that can communicate with each other.
We will create 2 agents:

travel_advisor: can help with travel destination recommendations. Can ask hotel_advisor for help.
hotel_advisor: can help with hotel recommendations. Can ask travel_advisor for help.

This is a fully-connected network - every agent can talk to any other agent. 
First, let's create some of the tools that the agents will be using:
import random
from typing_extensions import Literal
from langchain_core.tools import tool

@tool
def get_travel_recommendations():
    """Get recommendation for travel destinations"""
    return random.choice(["aruba", "turks and caicos"])

@tool
def get_hotel_recommendations(location: Literal["aruba", "turks and caicos"]):
    """Get hotel recommendations for a given destination."""
    return {
        "aruba": [
            "The Ritz-Carlton, Aruba (Palm Beach)"
            "Bucuti & Tara Beach Resort (Eagle Beach)"
        ],
        "turks and caicos": ["Grace Bay Club", "COMO Parrot Cay"],
    }[location]

@tool(return_direct=True)
def transfer_to_hotel_advisor():
    """Ask hotel advisor agent for help."""
    return "Successfully transferred to hotel advisor"

@tool(return_direct=True)
def transfer_to_travel_advisor():
    """Ask travel advisor agent for help."""
    return "Successfully transferred to travel advisor"

API Reference: tool

Transfer tools
You might have noticed that we're using @tool(return_direct=True) in the transfer tools. This is done so that individual agents (e.g., travel_advisor) can exit the ReAct loop early once these tools are called. This is the desired behavior, as we want to detect when the agent calls this tool and hand control off immediately to a different agent. 
NOTE: This is meant to work with the prebuilt create_react_agent -- if you are building a custom agent, make sure to manually add logic for handling early exit for tools that are marked with return_direct.

Now let's define our agent tasks and combine them into a single multi-agent network workflow:
from langchain_core.messages import AIMessage
from langchain_anthropic import ChatAnthropic
from langgraph.prebuilt import create_react_agent
from langgraph.graph import add_messages
from langgraph.func import entrypoint, task

model = ChatAnthropic(model="claude-3-5-sonnet-latest")

# Define travel advisor ReAct agent
travel_advisor_tools = [
    get_travel_recommendations,
    transfer_to_hotel_advisor,
]
travel_advisor = create_react_agent(
    model,
    travel_advisor_tools,
    state_modifier=(
        "You are a general travel expert that can recommend travel destinations (e.g. countries, cities, etc). "
        "If you need hotel recommendations, ask 'hotel_advisor' for help. "
        "You MUST include human-readable response before transferring to another agent."
    ),
)

@task
def call_travel_advisor(messages):
    # You can also add additional logic like changing the input to the agent / output from the agent, etc.
    # NOTE: we're invoking the ReAct agent with the full history of messages in the state
    response = travel_advisor.invoke({"messages": messages})
    return response["messages"]

# Define hotel advisor ReAct agent
hotel_advisor_tools = [get_hotel_recommendations, transfer_to_travel_advisor]
hotel_advisor = create_react_agent(
    model,
    hotel_advisor_tools,
    state_modifier=(
        "You are a hotel expert that can provide hotel recommendations for a given destination. "
        "If you need help picking travel destinations, ask 'travel_advisor' for help."
        "You MUST include human-readable response before transferring to another agent."
    ),
)

@task
def call_hotel_advisor(messages):
    response = hotel_advisor.invoke({"messages": messages})
    return response["messages"]

@entrypoint()
def workflow(messages):
    messages = add_messages([], messages)

    call_active_agent = call_travel_advisor
    while True:
        agent_messages = call_active_agent(messages).result()
        messages = add_messages(messages, agent_messages)
        ai_msg = next(m for m in reversed(agent_messages) if isinstance(m, AIMessage))
        if not ai_msg.tool_calls:
            break

        tool_call = ai_msg.tool_calls[-1]
        if tool_call["name"] == "transfer_to_travel_advisor":
            call_active_agent = call_travel_advisor
        elif tool_call["name"] == "transfer_to_hotel_advisor":
            call_active_agent = call_hotel_advisor
        else:
            raise ValueError(f"Expected transfer tool, got '{tool_call['name']}'")

    return messages

API Reference: AIMessage | ChatAnthropic | create_react_agent | add_messages | entrypoint | task
Lastly, let's define a helper to render the agent outputs:
from langchain_core.messages import convert_to_messages

def pretty_print_messages(update):
    if isinstance(update, tuple):
        ns, update = update
        # skip parent graph updates in the printouts
        if len(ns) == 0:
            return

        graph_id = ns[-1].split(":")[0]
        print(f"Update from subgraph {graph_id}:")
        print("\n")

    for node_name, node_update in update.items():
        print(f"Update from node {node_name}:")
        print("\n")

        for m in convert_to_messages(node_update["messages"]):
            m.pretty_print()
        print("\n")

API Reference: convert_to_messages
Let's test it out using the same input as our original multi-agent system:
for chunk in workflow.stream(
    [
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "i wanna go somewhere warm in the caribbean. pick one destination and give me hotel recommendations",
        }
    ],
    subgraphs=True,
):
    pretty_print_messages(chunk)

How to build a multi-agent network¶

Prerequisites
This guide assumes familiarity with the following:

How to implement handoffs between agents
Multi-agent systems
Command
LangGraph Glossary

In this how-to guide we will demonstrate how to implement a multi-agent network architecture where each agent can communicate with every other agent (many-to-many connections) and can decide which agent to call next. Individual agents will be defined as graph nodes.
To implement communication between the agents, we will be using handoffs:
def agent(state) -> Command[Literal["agent", "another_agent"]]:
    # the condition for routing/halting can be anything, e.g. LLM tool call / structured output, etc.
    goto = get_next_agent(...)  # 'agent' / 'another_agent'
    return Command(
        # Specify which agent to call next
        goto=goto,
        # Update the graph state
        update={"my_state_key": "my_state_value"}
    )

Setup¶
First, let's install the required packages
%%capture --no-stderr
%pip install -U langgraph langchain-anthropic

import getpass
import os

def _set_env(var: str):
    if not os.environ.get(var):
        os.environ[var] = getpass.getpass(f"{var}: ")

Set up LangSmith for LangGraph development

        Sign up for LangSmith to quickly spot issues and improve the performance of your LangGraph projects. LangSmith lets you use trace data to debug, test, and monitor your LLM apps built with LangGraph — read more about how to get started here. 
    

Using a custom agent implementation¶
In this example we will build a team of travel assistant agents that can communicate with each other via handoffs.
We will create 2 agents:

travel_advisor: can help with travel destination recommendations. Can ask hotel_advisor for help.
hotel_advisor: can help with hotel recommendations. Can ask travel_advisor for help.

This is a fully-connected network - every agent can talk to any other agent. 
Each agent will have a corresponding node function that can conditionally return a Command object (the handoff). The node function will use an LLM with a system prompt and a tool that lets it signal when it needs to hand off to another agent. If the LLM responds with the tool calls, we will return a Command(goto=<other_agent>).

Note: while we're using tools for the LLM to signal that it needs a handoff, the condition for the handoff can be anything: a specific response text from the LLM, structured output from the LLM, any other custom logic, etc.

Now, let's define our agent nodes and graph!
from typing_extensions import Literal

from langchain_core.messages import ToolMessage

    # This tool is not returning anything: we're just using it
    # as a way for LLM to signal that it needs to hand off to another agent
    # (See the paragraph above)
    return

@tool
def transfer_to_hotel_advisor():
    """Ask hotel advisor for help."""
    return

def travel_advisor(

    )
    messages = [{"role": "system", "content": system_prompt}] + state["messages"]
    ai_msg = model.bind_tools([transfer_to_hotel_advisor]).invoke(messages)
    # If there are tool calls, the LLM needs to hand off to another agent
    if len(ai_msg.tool_calls) > 0:
        tool_call_id = ai_msg.tool_calls[-1]["id"]

        # skip parent graph updates in the printouts

I'd be happy to help you plan a Caribbean vacation! The Caribbean is perfect for warm weather getaways. Let me suggest some fantastic destinations:

1. Dominican Republic
- Known for beautiful beaches, all-inclusive resorts, and tropical climate
- Popular areas include Punta Cana and Puerto Plata
- Great mix of beaches, culture, and activities

2. Jamaica
- Famous for its laid-back atmosphere and beautiful beaches
- Popular spots include Montego Bay, Negril, and Ocho Rios
- Known for reggae music, delicious cuisine, and water sports

3. Bahamas
- Crystal clear waters and stunning beaches
- Perfect for island hopping
- Great for water activities and swimming with pigs at Pig Beach

4. Turks and Caicos
- Pristine beaches and luxury resorts

You can see that in this case only the first agent (travel_advisor) ran. Let's now ask for more recommendations:
for chunk in graph.stream(
    {
        "messages": [
            (
                "user",

Would you like more specific information about any of these hotels or would you prefer to explore hotels in a different Caribbean destination?

Voila - travel_advisor picks a destination and then makes a decision to call hotel_advisor for more info!
Using with a prebuilt ReAct agent¶
Let's now see how we can implement the same team of travel agents, but give each of the agents some tools to call. We'll be using prebuilt create_react_agent to implement the agents. First, let's create some of the tools that the agents will be using:
import random
from typing_extensions import Literal

@tool
def get_travel_recommendations():
    """Get recommendation for travel destinations"""
    return random.choice(["aruba", "turks and caicos"])

@tool
def get_hotel_recommendations(location: Literal["aruba", "turks and caicos"]):
    """Get hotel recommendations for a given destination."""
    return {
        "aruba": [
            "The Ritz-Carlton, Aruba (Palm Beach)"
            "Bucuti & Tara Beach Resort (Eagle Beach)"
        ],
        "turks and caicos": ["Grace Bay Club", "COMO Parrot Cay"],
    }[location]

Let's also write a helper to create a handoff tool. See this how-to guide for a more in-depth walkthrough of how to make a handoff tool.
from typing import Annotated

from langchain_core.tools import tool
from langchain_core.tools.base import InjectedToolCallId
from langgraph.prebuilt import InjectedState

def make_handoff_tool(*, agent_name: str):
    """Create a tool that can return handoff via a Command"""
    tool_name = f"transfer_to_{agent_name}"

    @tool(tool_name)
    def handoff_to_agent(
        state: Annotated[dict, InjectedState],
        tool_call_id: Annotated[str, InjectedToolCallId],
    ):
        """Ask another agent for help."""
        tool_message = {
            "role": "tool",
            "content": f"Successfully transferred to {agent_name}",
            "name": tool_name,
            "tool_call_id": tool_call_id,
        }
        return Command(
            # navigate to another agent node in the PARENT graph
            goto=agent_name,
            graph=Command.PARENT,
            # This is the state update that the agent `agent_name` will see when it is invoked.
            # We're passing agent's FULL internal message history AND adding a tool message to make sure
            # the resulting chat history is valid.
            update={"messages": state["messages"] + [tool_message]},
        )

    return handoff_to_agent

API Reference: tool | InjectedToolCallId | InjectedState
Now let's define our agent nodes and combine them into a graph:
from langgraph.graph import MessagesState, StateGraph, START, END

    model,
    travel_advisor_tools,
    prompt=(
        "You are a general travel expert that can recommend travel destinations (e.g. countries, cities, etc). "
        "If you need hotel recommendations, ask 'hotel_advisor' for help. "
        "You MUST include human-readable response before transferring to another agent."
    ),
)

def call_travel_advisor(

How to add multi-turn conversation in a multi-agent application¶

Prerequisites
This guide assumes familiarity with the following:

How to implement handoffs between agents
Multi-agent systems
Human-in-the-loop
Command
LangGraph Glossary

In this how-to guide, we’ll build an application that allows an end-user to engage in a multi-turn conversation with one or more agents. We'll create a node that uses an interrupt to collect user input and routes back to the active agent.
The agents will be implemented as nodes in a graph that executes agent steps and determines the next action:  

Wait for user input to continue the conversation, or  
Route to another agent (or back to itself, such as in a loop) via a handoff.

def human(state: MessagesState) -> Command[Literal["agent", "another_agent"]]:
    """A node for collecting user input."""
    user_input = interrupt(value="Ready for user input.")

    # Determine the active agent.
    active_agent = ...

    ...
    return Command(
        update={
            "messages": [{
                "role": "human",
                "content": user_input,
            }]
        },
        goto=active_agent
    )

def agent(state) -> Command[Literal["agent", "another_agent", "human"]]:
    # The condition for routing/halting can be anything, e.g. LLM tool call / structured output, etc.
    goto = get_next_agent(...)  # 'agent' / 'another_agent'
    if goto:
        return Command(goto=goto, update={"my_state_key": "my_state_value"})
    else:
        return Command(goto="human") # Go to human node

Setup¶
First, let's install the required packages

Define agents¶
In this example, we will build a team of travel assistant agents that can communicate with each other via handoffs.
We will create 2 agents:

travel_advisor: can help with travel destination recommendations. Can ask hotel_advisor for help.
hotel_advisor: can help with hotel recommendations. Can ask travel_advisor for help.

We will be using prebuilt create_react_agent for the agents - each agent will have tools specific to its area of expertise as well as a special tool for handoffs to another agent.
First, let's define the tools we'll be using:
import random
from typing import Annotated, Literal

from langchain_core.tools import tool
from langchain_core.tools.base import InjectedToolCallId
from langgraph.prebuilt import InjectedState

@tool
def get_travel_recommendations():
    """Get recommendation for travel destinations"""
    return random.choice(["aruba", "turks and caicos"])

@tool
def get_hotel_recommendations(location: Literal["aruba", "turks and caicos"]):
    """Get hotel recommendations for a given destination."""
    return {
        "aruba": [
            "The Ritz-Carlton, Aruba (Palm Beach)"
            "Bucuti & Tara Beach Resort (Eagle Beach)"
        ],
        "turks and caicos": ["Grace Bay Club", "COMO Parrot Cay"],
    }[location]

def make_handoff_tool(*, agent_name: str):
    """Create a tool that can return handoff via a Command"""
    tool_name = f"transfer_to_{agent_name}"

    @tool(tool_name)
    def handoff_to_agent(
        state: Annotated[dict, InjectedState],
        tool_call_id: Annotated[str, InjectedToolCallId],
    ):
        """Ask another agent for help."""
        tool_message = {
            "role": "tool",
            "content": f"Successfully transferred to {agent_name}",
            "name": tool_name,
            "tool_call_id": tool_call_id,
        }
        return Command(
            # navigate to another agent node in the PARENT graph
            goto=agent_name,
            graph=Command.PARENT,
            # This is the state update that the agent `agent_name` will see when it is invoked.
            # We're passing agent's FULL internal message history AND adding a tool message to make sure
            # the resulting chat history is valid.
            update={"messages": state["messages"] + [tool_message]},
        )

    return handoff_to_agent

API Reference: tool | InjectedToolCallId | InjectedState
Let's now create our agents using the the prebuilt create_react_agent. We'll also define a dedicated human node with an interrupt -- we will route to this node after the final response from the agents. Note that to do so we're wrapping each agent invocation in a separate node function that returns Command(goto="human", ...).
from langchain_anthropic import ChatAnthropic

    # You can also add additional logic like changing the input to the agent / output from the agent, etc.

    response = travel_advisor.invoke(state)
    return Command(update=response, goto="human")

    ),
)

def call_hotel_advisor(
    state: MessagesState,

Test multi-turn conversation¶
Let's test a multi turn conversation with this application.
import uuid

thread_config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": uuid.uuid4()}}

inputs = [
    # 1st round of conversation,
    {
        "messages": [
            {"role": "user", "content": "i wanna go somewhere warm in the caribbean"}
        ]
    },
    # Since we're using `interrupt`, we'll need to resume using the Command primitive.
    # 2nd round of conversation,
    Command(
        resume="could you recommend a nice hotel in one of the areas and tell me which area it is."
    ),
    # 3rd round of conversation,
    Command(
        resume="i like the first one. could you recommend something to do near the hotel?"
    ),
]

for idx, user_input in enumerate(inputs):
    print()
    print(f"--- Conversation Turn {idx + 1} ---")
    print()
    print(f"User: {user_input}")
    print()
    for update in graph.stream(
        user_input,
        config=thread_config,
        stream_mode="updates",
    ):
        for node_id, value in update.items():
            if isinstance(value, dict) and value.get("messages", []):
                last_message = value["messages"][-1]
                if isinstance(last_message, dict) or last_message.type != "ai":
                    continue
                print(f"{node_id}: {last_message.content}")

--- Conversation Turn 1 ---

User: {'messages': [{'role': 'user', 'content': 'i wanna go somewhere warm in the caribbean'}]}

travel_advisor: Based on the recommendations, I suggest considering Aruba! It's a fantastic Caribbean destination known for its perfect warm weather year-round, with average temperatures around 82°F (28°C). Aruba is famous for its pristine white-sand beaches, crystal-clear waters, and constant cooling trade winds.

Some highlights of Aruba include:
1. Beautiful Eagle Beach and Palm Beach
2. Excellent snorkeling and diving opportunities
3. Vibrant culture and dining scene
4. Consistent sunny weather (it's outside the hurricane belt!)
5. Great shopping and nightlife in Oranjestad

Would you like me to help you explore more specific aspects of visiting Aruba? Or if you're interested in finding a hotel there, I can connect you with our hotel advisor who can provide detailed accommodation recommendations.

--- Conversation Turn 2 ---

User: Command(resume='could you recommend a nice hotel in one of the areas and tell me which area it is.')

hotel_advisor: Based on the recommendations, I can suggest two excellent options in different areas:

1. The Ritz-Carlton, Aruba - Located in Palm Beach
This luxury resort is situated in the bustling Palm Beach area, known for its high-rise hotels and vibrant atmosphere. The Ritz offers world-class amenities, including a luxurious spa, multiple restaurants, and a casino. The location is perfect if you want to be close to shopping, dining, and nightlife.

2. Bucuti & Tara Beach Resort - Located in Eagle Beach
This adults-only boutique resort is situated on the stunning Eagle Beach, which is wider and generally quieter than Palm Beach. It's perfect for those seeking a more peaceful, romantic atmosphere. The resort is known for its exceptional service and sustainability practices.

Would you like more specific information about either of these hotels or their locations?

--- Conversation Turn 3 ---

User: Command(resume='i like the first one. could you recommend something to do near the hotel?')

travel_advisor: Near The Ritz-Carlton in Palm Beach, there are several excellent activities you can enjoy:

1. Palm Beach Strip - Right outside the hotel, you can walk along this vibrant strip featuring:
   - High-end shopping at luxury boutiques
   - Various restaurants and bars
   - The Paseo Herencia Shopping & Entertainment Center

2. Water Activities (within walking distance):
   - Snorkeling at the artificial reef
   - Parasailing
   - Jet ski rentals
   - Catamaran sailing trips
   - Paddleboarding

3. Nearby Attractions:
   - Bubali Bird Sanctuary (5-minute drive)
   - Butterfly Farm (10-minute walk)
   - California Lighthouse (short drive)
   - Visit the famous Stellaris Casino (located within the Ritz-Carlton)

4. Local Culture:
   - Visit the nearby fishing pier
   - Take a short trip to local craft markets
   - Evening sunset watching on the beach

Would you like more specific information about any of these activities? I can also recommend some specific restaurants or shopping venues in the area!

API Reference: tool

Transfer tools
You might have noticed that we're using @tool(return_direct=True) in the transfer tools. This is done so that individual agents (e.g., travel_advisor) can exit the ReAct loop early once these tools are called. This is the desired behavior, as we want to detect when the agent calls this tool and hand control off immediately to a different agent. 
NOTE: This is meant to work with the prebuilt create_react_agent -- if you are building a custom agent, make sure to manually add logic for handling early exit for tools that are marked with return_direct.

Let's now create our agents using the the prebuilt create_react_agent and our multi-agent workflow. Note that will be calling interrupt every time after we get the final response from each of the agents.

How to view and update state in subgraphs¶

Prerequisites

        This guide assumes familiarity with the following:
        

                    Subgraphs
                

                    Human-in-the-loop
                

                    State
                

Once you add persistence, you can easily view and update the state of the subgraph at any point in time. This enables a lot of the human-in-the-loop interaction patterns:

You can surface a state during an interrupt to a user to let them accept an action.
You can rewind the subgraph to reproduce or avoid issues.
You can modify the state to let the user better control its actions.

This guide shows how you can do this.
Setup¶
First, let's install the required packages
%%capture --no-stderr
%pip install -U langgraph

Next, we need to set API keys for OpenAI (the LLM we will use):
import getpass
import os

def _set_env(var: str):
    if not os.environ.get(var):
        os.environ[var] = getpass.getpass(f"{var}: ")

_set_env("OPENAI_API_KEY")

Define subgraph¶
First, let's set up our subgraph. For this, we will create a simple graph that can get the weather for a specific city. We will compile this graph with a breakpoint before the weather_node:
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, END, START, MessagesState
from langchain_core.tools import tool
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

@tool
def get_weather(city: str):
    """Get the weather for a specific city"""
    return f"It's sunny in {city}!"

raw_model = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o")
model = raw_model.with_structured_output(get_weather)

class SubGraphState(MessagesState):
    city: str

def model_node(state: SubGraphState):
    result = model.invoke(state["messages"])
    return {"city": result["city"]}

def weather_node(state: SubGraphState):
    result = get_weather.invoke({"city": state["city"]})
    return {"messages": [{"role": "assistant", "content": result}]}

subgraph = StateGraph(SubGraphState)
subgraph.add_node(model_node)
subgraph.add_node(weather_node)
subgraph.add_edge(START, "model_node")
subgraph.add_edge("model_node", "weather_node")
subgraph.add_edge("weather_node", END)
subgraph = subgraph.compile(interrupt_before=["weather_node"])

API Reference: StateGraph | END | START | tool | ChatOpenAI
Define parent graph¶
We can now setup the overall graph. This graph will first route to the subgraph if it needs to get the weather, otherwise it will route to a normal LLM.
from typing import Literal
from typing_extensions import TypedDict
from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver

memory = MemorySaver()

class RouterState(MessagesState):
    route: Literal["weather", "other"]

class Router(TypedDict):
    route: Literal["weather", "other"]

router_model = raw_model.with_structured_output(Router)

def router_node(state: RouterState):
    system_message = "Classify the incoming query as either about weather or not."
    messages = [{"role": "system", "content": system_message}] + state["messages"]
    route = router_model.invoke(messages)
    return {"route": route["route"]}

def normal_llm_node(state: RouterState):
    response = raw_model.invoke(state["messages"])
    return {"messages": [response]}

def route_after_prediction(
    state: RouterState,
) -> Literal["weather_graph", "normal_llm_node"]:
    if state["route"] == "weather":
        return "weather_graph"
    else:
        return "normal_llm_node"

graph = StateGraph(RouterState)
graph.add_node(router_node)
graph.add_node(normal_llm_node)
graph.add_node("weather_graph", subgraph)
graph.add_edge(START, "router_node")
graph.add_conditional_edges("router_node", route_after_prediction)
graph.add_edge("normal_llm_node", END)
graph.add_edge("weather_graph", END)
graph = graph.compile(checkpointer=memory)

API Reference: MemorySaver
from IPython.display import Image, display

# Setting xray to 1 will show the internal structure of the nested graph
display(Image(graph.get_graph(xray=1).draw_mermaid_png()))

Let's test this out with a normal query to make sure it works as intended!
config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "1"}}
inputs = {"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "hi!"}]}
for update in graph.stream(inputs, config=config, stream_mode="updates"):
    print(update)

{'router_node': {'route': 'other'}}
{'normal_llm_node': {'messages': [AIMessage(content='Hello! How can I assist you today?', additional_kwargs={'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 9, 'prompt_tokens': 9, 'total_tokens': 18, 'completion_tokens_details': {'reasoning_tokens': 0}}, 'model_name': 'gpt-3.5-turbo-0125', 'system_fingerprint': None, 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, id='run-35de4577-2117-40e4-ab3b-cd2ac6e27b4c-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 9, 'output_tokens': 9, 'total_tokens': 18})]}}

Great! We didn't ask about the weather, so we got a normal response from the LLM.
Resuming from breakpoints¶
Let's now look at what happens with breakpoints. Let's invoke it with a query that should get routed to the weather subgraph where we have the interrupt node.
config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "2"}}
inputs = {"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "what's the weather in sf"}]}
for update in graph.stream(inputs, config=config, stream_mode="updates"):
    print(update)

{'router_node': {'route': 'weather'}}

Note that the graph stream doesn't include subgraph events. If we want to stream subgraph events, we can pass subgraphs=True and get back subgraph events like so:
config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "3"}}
inputs = {"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "what's the weather in sf"}]}
for update in graph.stream(inputs, config=config, stream_mode="values", subgraphs=True):
    print(update)

((), {'messages': [HumanMessage(content="what's the weather in sf", additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id='108eb27a-2cbf-48d2-a6e7-6e07e82eafbc')]})
((), {'messages': [HumanMessage(content="what's the weather in sf", additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id='108eb27a-2cbf-48d2-a6e7-6e07e82eafbc')], 'route': 'weather'})
(('weather_graph:0c47aeb3-6f4d-5e68-ccf4-42bd48e8ef20',), {'messages': [HumanMessage(content="what's the weather in sf", additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id='108eb27a-2cbf-48d2-a6e7-6e07e82eafbc')]})
(('weather_graph:0c47aeb3-6f4d-5e68-ccf4-42bd48e8ef20',), {'messages': [HumanMessage(content="what's the weather in sf", additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id='108eb27a-2cbf-48d2-a6e7-6e07e82eafbc')], 'city': 'San Francisco'})

If we get the state now, we can see that it's paused on weather_graph
state = graph.get_state(config)
state.next

('weather_graph',)

If we look at the pending tasks for our current state, we can see that we have one task named weather_graph, which corresponds to the subgraph task.
state.tasks

(PregelTask(id='0c47aeb3-6f4d-5e68-ccf4-42bd48e8ef20', name='weather_graph', path=('__pregel_pull', 'weather_graph'), error=None, interrupts=(), state={'configurable': {'thread_id': '3', 'checkpoint_ns': 'weather_graph:0c47aeb3-6f4d-5e68-ccf4-42bd48e8ef20'}}),)

However since we got the state using the config of the parent graph, we don't have access to the subgraph state. If you look at the state value of the PregelTask above you will note that it is simply the configuration of the parent graph. If we want to actually populate the subgraph state, we can pass in subgraphs=True to get_state like so:
state = graph.get_state(config, subgraphs=True)
state.tasks[0]

PregelTask(id='0c47aeb3-6f4d-5e68-ccf4-42bd48e8ef20', name='weather_graph', path=('__pregel_pull', 'weather_graph'), error=None, interrupts=(), state=StateSnapshot(values={'messages': [HumanMessage(content="what's the weather in sf", additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id='108eb27a-2cbf-48d2-a6e7-6e07e82eafbc')], 'city': 'San Francisco'}, next=('weather_node',), config={'configurable': {'thread_id': '3', 'checkpoint_ns': 'weather_graph:0c47aeb3-6f4d-5e68-ccf4-42bd48e8ef20', 'checkpoint_id': '1ef75ee0-d9c3-6242-8001-440e7a3fb19f', 'checkpoint_map': {'': '1ef75ee0-d4e8-6ede-8001-2542067239ef', 'weather_graph:0c47aeb3-6f4d-5e68-ccf4-42bd48e8ef20': '1ef75ee0-d9c3-6242-8001-440e7a3fb19f'}}}, metadata={'source': 'loop', 'writes': {'model_node': {'city': 'San Francisco'}}, 'step': 1, 'parents': {'': '1ef75ee0-d4e8-6ede-8001-2542067239ef'}}, created_at='2024-09-18T18:44:36.278105+00:00', parent_config={'configurable': {'thread_id': '3', 'checkpoint_ns': 'weather_graph:0c47aeb3-6f4d-5e68-ccf4-42bd48e8ef20', 'checkpoint_id': '1ef75ee0-d4ef-6dec-8000-5d5724f3ef73'}}, tasks=(PregelTask(id='26f4384a-41d7-5ca9-cb94-4001de62e8aa', name='weather_node', path=('__pregel_pull', 'weather_node'), error=None, interrupts=(), state=None),)))

Now we have access to the subgraph state! If you look at the state value of the PregelTask you can see that it has all the information we need, like the next node (weather_node) and the current state values (e.g. city).
To resume execution, we can just invoke the outer graph as normal:
for update in graph.stream(None, config=config, stream_mode="values", subgraphs=True):
    print(update)

((), {'messages': [HumanMessage(content="what's the weather in sf", additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id='108eb27a-2cbf-48d2-a6e7-6e07e82eafbc')], 'route': 'weather'})
(('weather_graph:0c47aeb3-6f4d-5e68-ccf4-42bd48e8ef20',), {'messages': [HumanMessage(content="what's the weather in sf", additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id='108eb27a-2cbf-48d2-a6e7-6e07e82eafbc')], 'city': 'San Francisco'})
(('weather_graph:0c47aeb3-6f4d-5e68-ccf4-42bd48e8ef20',), {'messages': [HumanMessage(content="what's the weather in sf", additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id='108eb27a-2cbf-48d2-a6e7-6e07e82eafbc'), AIMessage(content="It's sunny in San Francisco!", additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id='c996ce37-438c-44f4-9e60-5aed8bcdae8a')], 'city': 'San Francisco'})
((), {'messages': [HumanMessage(content="what's the weather in sf", additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id='108eb27a-2cbf-48d2-a6e7-6e07e82eafbc'), AIMessage(content="It's sunny in San Francisco!", additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id='c996ce37-438c-44f4-9e60-5aed8bcdae8a')], 'route': 'weather'})

Resuming from specific subgraph node¶
In the example above, we were replaying from the outer graph - which automatically replayed the subgraph from whatever state it was in previously (paused before the weather_node in our case), but it is also possible to replay from inside a subgraph. In order to do so, we need to get the configuration from the exact subgraph state that we want to replay from.
We can do this by exploring the state history of the subgraph, and selecting the state before model_node - which we can do by filtering on the .next parameter.
To get the state history of the subgraph, we need to first pass in  
parent_graph_state_before_subgraph = next(
    h for h in graph.get_state_history(config) if h.next == ("weather_graph",)
)

subgraph_state_before_model_node = next(
    h
    for h in graph.get_state_history(parent_graph_state_before_subgraph.tasks[0].state)
    if h.next == ("model_node",)
)

# This pattern can be extended no matter how many levels deep
# subsubgraph_stat_history = next(h for h in graph.get_state_history(subgraph_state_before_model_node.tasks[0].state) if h.next == ('my_subsubgraph_node',))

We can confirm that we have gotten the correct state by comparing the .next parameter of the subgraph_state_before_model_node.
subgraph_state_before_model_node.next

('model_node',)

Perfect! We have gotten the correct state snaphshot, and we can now resume from the model_node inside of our subgraph:
for value in graph.stream(
    None,
    config=subgraph_state_before_model_node.config,
    stream_mode="values",
    subgraphs=True,
):
    print(value)

((), {'messages': [HumanMessage(content="what's the weather in sf", additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id='108eb27a-2cbf-48d2-a6e7-6e07e82eafbc')], 'route': 'weather'})
(('weather_graph:0c47aeb3-6f4d-5e68-ccf4-42bd48e8ef20',), {'messages': [HumanMessage(content="what's the weather in sf", additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id='108eb27a-2cbf-48d2-a6e7-6e07e82eafbc')]})
(('weather_graph:0c47aeb3-6f4d-5e68-ccf4-42bd48e8ef20',), {'messages': [HumanMessage(content="what's the weather in sf", additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id='108eb27a-2cbf-48d2-a6e7-6e07e82eafbc')], 'city': 'San Francisco'})

Great, this subsection has shown how you can replay from any node, no matter how deeply nested it is inside your graph - a powerful tool for testing how deterministic your agent is.
Modifying state¶
Update the state of a subgraph¶
What if we want to modify the state of a subgraph? We can do this similarly to how we update the state of normal graphs, just being careful to pass in the config of the subgraph to update_state.
config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "4"}}
inputs = {"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "what's the weather in sf"}]}
for update in graph.stream(inputs, config=config, stream_mode="updates"):
    print(update)

{'router_node': {'route': 'weather'}}

state = graph.get_state(config, subgraphs=True)
state.values["messages"]

[HumanMessage(content="what's the weather in sf", additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id='05ee2159-3b25-4d6c-97d6-82beda3cabd4')]

In order to update the state of the inner graph, we need to pass the config for the inner graph, which we can get by accessing calling state.tasks[0].state.config - since we interrupted inside the subgraph, the state of the task is just the state of the subgraph.
graph.update_state(state.tasks[0].state.config, {"city": "la"})

{'configurable': {'thread_id': '4',
  'checkpoint_ns': 'weather_graph:67f32ef7-aee0-8a20-0eb0-eeea0fd6de6e',
  'checkpoint_id': '1ef75e5a-0b00-6bc0-8002-5726e210fef4',
  'checkpoint_map': {'': '1ef75e59-1b13-6ffe-8001-0844ae748fd5',
   'weather_graph:67f32ef7-aee0-8a20-0eb0-eeea0fd6de6e': '1ef75e5a-0b00-6bc0-8002-5726e210fef4'}}}

We can now resume streaming the outer graph (which will resume the subgraph!) and check that we updated our search to use LA instead of SF.
for update in graph.stream(None, config=config, stream_mode="updates", subgraphs=True):
    print(update)

(('weather_graph:9e512e8e-bac5-5412-babe-fe5c12a47cc2',), {'weather_node': {'messages': [{'role': 'assistant', 'content': "It's sunny in la!"}]}})
((), {'weather_graph': {'messages': [HumanMessage(content="what's the weather in sf", id='35e331c6-eb47-483c-a63c-585877b12f5d'), AIMessage(content="It's sunny in la!", id='c3d6b224-9642-4b21-94d5-eef8dc3f2cc9')]}})

Fantastic! The AI responded with "It's sunny in LA!" as we expected.
Acting as a subgraph node¶
Another way we could update the state is by acting as the weather_node ourselves instead of editing the state before weather_node is ran as we did above. We can do this by passing the subgraph config and also the as_node argument, which allows us to update the state as if we are the node we specify. Thus by setting an interrupt before the weather_node and then using the update state function as the weather_node, the graph itself never calls weather_node directly but instead we decide what the output of weather_node should be.
config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "14"}}
inputs = {"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "what's the weather in sf"}]}
for update in graph.stream(
    inputs, config=config, stream_mode="updates", subgraphs=True
):
    print(update)
# Graph execution should stop before the weather node
print("interrupted!")

state = graph.get_state(config, subgraphs=True)

# We update the state by passing in the message we want returned from the weather node, and make sure to use as_node
graph.update_state(
    state.tasks[0].state.config,
    {"messages": [{"role": "assistant", "content": "rainy"}]},
    as_node="weather_node",
)
for update in graph.stream(None, config=config, stream_mode="updates", subgraphs=True):
    print(update)

print(graph.get_state(config).values["messages"])

((), {'router_node': {'route': 'weather'}})

Perfect! The AI responded with the message we passed in ourselves.
Acting as the entire subgraph¶
Lastly, we could also update the graph just acting as the entire subgraph. This is similar to the case above but instead of acting as just the weather_node we are acting as the entire subgraph. This is done by passing in the normal graph config as well as the as_node argument, where we specify the we are acting as the entire subgraph node.
config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "8"}}
inputs = {"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "what's the weather in sf"}]}
for update in graph.stream(
    inputs, config=config, stream_mode="updates", subgraphs=True
):
    print(update)
# Graph execution should stop before the weather node
print("interrupted!")

# We update the state by passing in the message we want returned from the weather graph, making sure to use as_node
# Note that we don't need to pass in the subgraph config, since we aren't updating the state inside the subgraph
graph.update_state(
    config,
    {"messages": [{"role": "assistant", "content": "rainy"}]},
    as_node="weather_graph",
)
for update in graph.stream(None, config=config, stream_mode="updates"):
    print(update)

print(graph.get_state(config).values["messages"])

((), {'router_node': {'route': 'weather'}})
(('weather_graph:53ab3fb1-23e8-5de0-acc6-9fb904fd4dc4',), {'model_node': {'city': 'San Francisco'}})
interrupted!
[HumanMessage(content="what's the weather in sf", id='64b1b683-778b-4623-b783-4a8f81322ec8'), AIMessage(content='rainy', id='c1d1a2f3-c117-41e9-8c1f-8fb0a02a3b70')]

Again, the AI responded with "rainy" as we expected.
Double nested subgraphs¶
This same functionality continues to work no matter the level of nesting. Here is an example of doing the same things with a double nested subgraph (although any level of nesting will work). We add another router on top of our already defined graphs.
from typing import Literal
from typing_extensions import TypedDict
from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver

memory = MemorySaver()

class RouterState(MessagesState):
    route: Literal["weather", "other"]

class Router(TypedDict):

router_model = raw_model.with_structured_output(Router)

def router_node(state: RouterState):
    system_message = "Classify the incoming query as either about weather or not."
    messages = [{"role": "system", "content": system_message}] + state["messages"]
    route = router_model.invoke(messages)
    return {"route": route["route"]}

def normal_llm_node(state: RouterState):
    response = raw_model.invoke(state["messages"])
    return {"messages": [response]}

def route_after_prediction(
    state: RouterState,
) -> Literal["weather_graph", "normal_llm_node"]:
    if state["route"] == "weather":
        return "weather_graph"
    else:
        return "normal_llm_node"

graph = StateGraph(RouterState)
graph.add_node(router_node)
graph.add_node(normal_llm_node)
graph.add_node("weather_graph", subgraph)
graph.add_edge(START, "router_node")
graph.add_conditional_edges("router_node", route_after_prediction)
graph.add_edge("normal_llm_node", END)
graph.add_edge("weather_graph", END)
graph = graph.compile()

    return {"to_continue": True}

def route_after_prediction(state: GrandfatherState):
    if state["to_continue"]:
        return "graph"
    else:
        return END

grandparent_graph = StateGraph(GrandfatherState)
grandparent_graph.add_node(router_node)
grandparent_graph.add_node("graph", graph)
grandparent_graph.add_edge(START, "router_node")
grandparent_graph.add_conditional_edges(
    "router_node", route_after_prediction, ["graph", END]
)
grandparent_graph.add_edge("graph", END)
grandparent_graph = grandparent_graph.compile(checkpointer=MemorySaver())

from IPython.display import Image, display

# Setting xray to 1 will show the internal structure of the nested graph
display(Image(grandparent_graph.get_graph(xray=2).draw_mermaid_png()))

If we run until the interrupt, we can now see that there are snapshots of the state of all three graphs
config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "2"}}
inputs = {"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "what's the weather in sf"}]}
for update in grandparent_graph.stream(
    inputs, config=config, stream_mode="updates", subgraphs=True
):
    print(update)

((), {'router_node': {'to_continue': True}})
(('graph:e18ecd45-5dfb-53b0-bcb7-db793924e9a8',), {'router_node': {'route': 'weather'}})
(('graph:e18ecd45-5dfb-53b0-bcb7-db793924e9a8', 'weather_graph:12bd3069-de24-5bc6-b4f1-f39527605781'), {'model_node': {'city': 'San Francisco'}})

state = grandparent_graph.get_state(config, subgraphs=True)
print("Grandparent State:")
print(state.values)
print("---------------")
print("Parent Graph State:")
print(state.tasks[0].state.values)
print("---------------")
print("Subgraph State:")
print(state.tasks[0].state.tasks[0].state.values)

Grandparent State:
{'messages': [HumanMessage(content="what's the weather in sf", id='3bb28060-3d30-49a7-9f84-c90b6ada7848')], 'to_continue': True}
---------------
Parent Graph State:
{'messages': [HumanMessage(content="what's the weather in sf", id='3bb28060-3d30-49a7-9f84-c90b6ada7848')], 'route': 'weather'}
---------------
Subgraph State:
{'messages': [HumanMessage(content="what's the weather in sf", id='3bb28060-3d30-49a7-9f84-c90b6ada7848')], 'city': 'San Francisco'}

We can now continue, acting as the node three levels down
grandparent_graph_state = state
parent_graph_state = grandparent_graph_state.tasks[0].state
subgraph_state = parent_graph_state.tasks[0].state
grandparent_graph.update_state(
    subgraph_state.config,
    {"messages": [{"role": "assistant", "content": "rainy"}]},
    as_node="weather_node",
)
for update in grandparent_graph.stream(
    None, config=config, stream_mode="updates", subgraphs=True

    print(update)

print(grandparent_graph.get_state(config).values["messages"])

As in the cases above, we can see that the AI responds with "rainy" as we expect.
We can explore the state history to see how the state of the grandparent graph was updated at each step.
for state in grandparent_graph.get_state_history(config):
    print(state)
    print("-----")

How to add thread-level persistence to a subgraph¶

Prerequisites

        This guide assumes familiarity with the following:
        

                    Subgraphs
                

                    Persistence
                

This guide shows how you can add thread-level persistence to graphs that use subgraphs.
Setup¶
First, let's install the required packages
%%capture --no-stderr
%pip install -U langgraph

Set up LangSmith for LangGraph development

        Sign up for LangSmith to quickly spot issues and improve the performance of your LangGraph projects. LangSmith lets you use trace data to debug, test, and monitor your LLM apps built with LangGraph — read more about how to get started here. 
    

Define the graph with persistence¶
To add persistence to a graph with subgraphs, all you need to do is pass a checkpointer when compiling the parent graph. LangGraph will automatically propagate the checkpointer to the child subgraphs.

Note
You shouldn't provide a checkpointer when compiling a subgraph. Instead, you must define a single checkpointer that you pass to parent_graph.compile(), and LangGraph will automatically propagate the checkpointer to the child subgraphs. If you pass the checkpointer to the subgraph.compile(), it will simply be ignored. This also applies when you add a node function that invokes the subgraph.

Let's define a simple graph with a single subgraph node to show how to do this.
from langgraph.graph import START, StateGraph
from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver
from typing import TypedDict

# subgraph

class SubgraphState(TypedDict):
    foo: str  # note that this key is shared with the parent graph state
    bar: str

def subgraph_node_1(state: SubgraphState):
    return {"bar": "bar"}

def subgraph_node_2(state: SubgraphState):
    # note that this node is using a state key ('bar') that is only available in the subgraph
    # and is sending update on the shared state key ('foo')
    return {"foo": state["foo"] + state["bar"]}

subgraph_builder = StateGraph(SubgraphState)
subgraph_builder.add_node(subgraph_node_1)
subgraph_builder.add_node(subgraph_node_2)
subgraph_builder.add_edge(START, "subgraph_node_1")
subgraph_builder.add_edge("subgraph_node_1", "subgraph_node_2")
subgraph = subgraph_builder.compile()

# parent graph

class State(TypedDict):
    foo: str

def node_1(state: State):
    return {"foo": "hi! " + state["foo"]}

builder = StateGraph(State)
builder.add_node("node_1", node_1)
# note that we're adding the compiled subgraph as a node to the parent graph
builder.add_node("node_2", subgraph)
builder.add_edge(START, "node_1")
builder.add_edge("node_1", "node_2")

API Reference: START | StateGraph | MemorySaver
<langgraph.graph.state.StateGraph at 0x106d2fa10>

We can now compile the graph with an in-memory checkpointer (MemorySaver).
checkpointer = MemorySaver()
# You must only pass checkpointer when compiling the parent graph.
# LangGraph will automatically propagate the checkpointer to the child subgraphs.
graph = builder.compile(checkpointer=checkpointer)

Verify persistence works¶
Let's now run the graph and inspect the persisted state for both the parent graph and the subgraph to verify that persistence works. We should expect to see the final execution results for both the parent and subgraph in state.values.
config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "1"}}

for _, chunk in graph.stream({"foo": "foo"}, config, subgraphs=True):
    print(chunk)

{'node_1': {'foo': 'hi! foo'}}
{'subgraph_node_1': {'bar': 'bar'}}
{'subgraph_node_2': {'foo': 'hi! foobar'}}
{'node_2': {'foo': 'hi! foobar'}}

We can now view the parent graph state by calling graph.get_state() with the same config that we used to invoke the graph.
graph.get_state(config).values

{'foo': 'hi! foobar'}

To view the subgraph state, we need to do two things:

Find the most recent config value for the subgraph
Use graph.get_state() to retrieve that value for the most recent subgraph config.

To find the correct config, we can examine the state history from the parent graph and find the state snapshot before we return results from node_2 (the node with subgraph):
state_with_subgraph = [
    s for s in graph.get_state_history(config) if s.next == ("node_2",)
][0]

The state snapshot will include the list of tasks to be executed next. When using subgraphs, the tasks will contain the config that we can use to retrieve the subgraph state:
subgraph_config = state_with_subgraph.tasks[0].state
subgraph_config

{'configurable': {'thread_id': '1',
  'checkpoint_ns': 'node_2:6ef111a6-f290-7376-0dfc-a4152307bc5b'}}

graph.get_state(subgraph_config).values

{'foo': 'hi! foobar', 'bar': 'bar'}

CONTENT:
How to add summary of the conversation history¶
One of the most common use cases for persistence is to use it to keep track of conversation history. This is great - it makes it easy to continue conversations. As conversations get longer and longer, however, this conversation history can build up and take up more and more of the context window. This can often be undesirable as it leads to more expensive and longer calls to the LLM, and potentially ones that error. One way to work around that is to create a summary of the conversation to date, and use that with the past N messages. This guide will go through an example of how to do that.
This will involve a few steps:

Check if the conversation is too long (can be done by checking number of messages or length of messages)
If yes, the create summary (will need a prompt for this)
Then remove all except the last N messages

A big part of this is deleting old messages. For an in depth guide on how to do that, see this guide
Setup¶
First, let's set up the packages we're going to want to use
%%capture --no-stderr
%pip install --quiet -U langgraph langchain_anthropic

Next, we need to set API keys for Anthropic (the LLM we will use)
import getpass
import os

def _set_env(var: str):
    if not os.environ.get(var):
        os.environ[var] = getpass.getpass(f"{var}: ")

_set_env("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY")

==================================[1m Ai Message [0m==================================

That's great, the Celtics are a fun team to follow! Basketball is an exciting sport. Do you have a favorite Celtics player or a favorite moment from a Celtics game you've watched? I'd be happy to discuss the team and the sport with you.

We can see that so far no summarization has happened - this is because there are only six messages in the list.
values = app.get_state(config).values
values

{'messages': [HumanMessage(content="hi! I'm bob", id='6534853d-b8a7-44b9-837b-eb7abaf7ebf7'),

That's understandable, the Celtics have been one of the more successful NBA franchises over the years. Their history of winning championships is very impressive. It's always fun to follow a team that regularly competes for titles. What do you think has been the key to the Celtics' sustained success? Is there a particular era or team that stands out as your favorite?

Here is a summary of our conversation so far:

- You introduced yourself as Bob and said you like the Boston Celtics basketball team.
- I acknowledged that it's nice to meet you, Bob, and noted that you had shared your name earlier in the conversation.
- You expressed that you like how much the Celtics win, and I agreed that their history of sustained success and championship pedigree is impressive.
- I asked if you have a favorite Celtics player or moment that stands out to you, and invited further discussion about the team and the sport of basketball.
- The overall tone has been friendly and conversational, with me trying to engage with your interest in the Celtics by asking follow-up questions.

If we check the state now, we can see that we have a summary of the conversation, as well as the last two messages
values = app.get_state(config).values

We can now resume having a conversation! Note that even though we only have the last two messages, we can still ask it questions about things mentioned earlier in the conversation (because we summarized those)
input_message = HumanMessage(content="what's my name?")
input_message.pretty_print()
for event in app.stream({"messages": [input_message]}, config, stream_mode="updates"):
    print_update(event)

================================[1m Human Message [0m=================================

In our conversation so far, you introduced yourself as Bob. I acknowledged that earlier when you had shared your name.

input_message = HumanMessage(content="what NFL team do you think I like?")
input_message.pretty_print()
for event in app.stream({"messages": [input_message]}, config, stream_mode="updates"):
    print_update(event)

================================[1m Human Message [0m=================================

what NFL team do you think I like?
==================================[1m Ai Message [0m==================================

I don't actually have any information about what NFL team you might like. In our conversation so far, you've only mentioned that you're a fan of the Boston Celtics basketball team. I don't have any prior knowledge about your preferences for NFL teams. Unless you provide me with that information, I don't have a basis to guess which NFL team you might be a fan of.

input_message = HumanMessage(content="i like the patriots!")
input_message.pretty_print()
for event in app.stream({"messages": [input_message]}, config, stream_mode="updates"):
    print_update(event)

================================[1m Human Message [0m=================================

i like the patriots!
==================================[1m Ai Message [0m==================================

Okay, got it! Thanks for sharing that you're also a fan of the New England Patriots in the NFL. That makes sense, given your interest in other Boston sports teams like the Celtics. The Patriots have also had a very successful run over the past couple of decades, winning multiple Super Bowls. It's fun to follow winning franchises like the Celtics and Patriots. Do you have a favorite Patriots player or moment that stands out to you?

Okay, extending the summary with the new information:

- You initially introduced yourself as Bob and said you like the Boston Celtics basketball team. 
- I acknowledged that and we discussed your appreciation for the Celtics' history of winning.
- You then asked what your name was, and I reminded you that you had introduced yourself as Bob earlier in the conversation.
- You followed up by asking what NFL team I thought you might like, and I explained that I didn't have any prior information about your NFL team preferences.
- You then revealed that you are also a fan of the New England Patriots, which made sense given your Celtics fandom.
- I responded positively to this new information, noting the Patriots' own impressive success and dynasty over the past couple of decades.
- I then asked if you have a particular favorite Patriots player or moment that stands out to you, continuing the friendly, conversational tone.

Overall, the discussion has focused on your sports team preferences, with you sharing that you are a fan of both the Celtics and the Patriots. I've tried to engage with your interests and ask follow-up questions to keep the dialogue flowing.

How to manage conversation history¶
One of the most common use cases for persistence is to use it to keep track of conversation history. This is great - it makes it easy to continue conversations. As conversations get longer and longer, however, this conversation history can build up and take up more and more of the context window. This can often be undesirable as it leads to more expensive and longer calls to the LLM, and potentially ones that error. In order to prevent this from happening, you need to properly manage the conversation history.
Note: this guide focuses on how to do this in LangGraph, where you can fully customize how this is done. If you want a more off-the-shelf solution, you can look into functionality provided in LangChain:

How to filter messages
How to trim messages

Setup¶
First, let's set up the packages we're going to want to use
%%capture --no-stderr
%pip install --quiet -U langgraph langchain_anthropic

Next, we need to set API keys for Anthropic (the LLM we will use)
import getpass
import os

def _set_env(var: str):
    if not os.environ.get(var):
        os.environ[var] = getpass.getpass(f"{var}: ")

_set_env("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY")

Build the agent¶
Let's now build a simple ReAct style agent.
from typing import Literal

from langchain_anthropic import ChatAnthropic
from langchain_core.tools import tool

from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver
from langgraph.graph import MessagesState, StateGraph, START, END
from langgraph.prebuilt import ToolNode

memory = MemorySaver()

@tool
def search(query: str):
    """Call to surf the web."""
    # This is a placeholder for the actual implementation
    # Don't let the LLM know this though 😊
    return "It's sunny in San Francisco, but you better look out if you're a Gemini 😈."

tools = [search]
tool_node = ToolNode(tools)
model = ChatAnthropic(model_name="claude-3-haiku-20240307")
bound_model = model.bind_tools(tools)

def should_continue(state: MessagesState):
    """Return the next node to execute."""
    last_message = state["messages"][-1]
    # If there is no function call, then we finish
    if not last_message.tool_calls:
        return END
    # Otherwise if there is, we continue
    return "action"

# Define the function that calls the model
def call_model(state: MessagesState):
    response = bound_model.invoke(state["messages"])
    # We return a list, because this will get added to the existing list
    return {"messages": response}

# Define a new graph
workflow = StateGraph(MessagesState)

# Define the two nodes we will cycle between
workflow.add_node("agent", call_model)
workflow.add_node("action", tool_node)

# Set the entrypoint as `agent`
# This means that this node is the first one called
workflow.add_edge(START, "agent")

# We now add a conditional edge
workflow.add_conditional_edges(
    # First, we define the start node. We use `agent`.
    # This means these are the edges taken after the `agent` node is called.
    "agent",
    # Next, we pass in the function that will determine which node is called next.
    should_continue,
    # Next, we pass in the path map - all the possible nodes this edge could go to
    ["action", END],
)

# We now add a normal edge from `tools` to `agent`.
# This means that after `tools` is called, `agent` node is called next.
workflow.add_edge("action", "agent")

# Finally, we compile it!
# This compiles it into a LangChain Runnable,
# meaning you can use it as you would any other runnable
app = workflow.compile(checkpointer=memory)

API Reference: ChatAnthropic | tool | MemorySaver | StateGraph | START | END | ToolNode
from langchain_core.messages import HumanMessage

config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "2"}}
input_message = HumanMessage(content="hi! I'm bob")
for event in app.stream({"messages": [input_message]}, config, stream_mode="values"):
    event["messages"][-1].pretty_print()

input_message = HumanMessage(content="what's my name?")
for event in app.stream({"messages": [input_message]}, config, stream_mode="values"):
    event["messages"][-1].pretty_print()

API Reference: HumanMessage
================================[1m Human Message [0m=================================

hi! I'm bob
==================================[1m Ai Message [0m==================================

Nice to meet you, Bob! As an AI assistant, I don't have a physical form, but I'm happy to chat with you and try my best to help out however I can. Please feel free to ask me anything, and I'll do my best to provide useful information or assistance.

You said your name is Bob, so that is the name I have for you.

Filtering messages¶
The most straight-forward thing to do to prevent conversation history from blowing up is to filter the list of messages before they get passed to the LLM. This involves two parts: defining a function to filter messages, and then adding it to the graph. See the example below which defines a really simple filter_messages function and then uses it.
from typing import Literal

from langchain_anthropic import ChatAnthropic
from langchain_core.tools import tool

from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver
from langgraph.graph import MessagesState, StateGraph, START
from langgraph.prebuilt import ToolNode

memory = MemorySaver()

@tool
def search(query: str):
    """Call to surf the web."""
    # This is a placeholder for the actual implementation
    # Don't let the LLM know this though 😊
    return "It's sunny in San Francisco, but you better look out if you're a Gemini 😈."

tools = [search]
tool_node = ToolNode(tools)
model = ChatAnthropic(model_name="claude-3-haiku-20240307")
bound_model = model.bind_tools(tools)

def should_continue(state: MessagesState):
    """Return the next node to execute."""
    last_message = state["messages"][-1]
    # If there is no function call, then we finish
    if not last_message.tool_calls:
        return END
    # Otherwise if there is, we continue
    return "action"

def filter_messages(messages: list):
    # This is very simple helper function which only ever uses the last message
    return messages[-1:]

# Define the function that calls the model
def call_model(state: MessagesState):
    messages = filter_messages(state["messages"])
    response = bound_model.invoke(messages)
    # We return a list, because this will get added to the existing list
    return {"messages": response}

# Define a new graph
workflow = StateGraph(MessagesState)

# Define the two nodes we will cycle between
workflow.add_node("agent", call_model)
workflow.add_node("action", tool_node)

# Set the entrypoint as `agent`
# This means that this node is the first one called
workflow.add_edge(START, "agent")

# We now add a conditional edge
workflow.add_conditional_edges(
    # First, we define the start node. We use `agent`.
    # This means these are the edges taken after the `agent` node is called.
    "agent",
    # Next, we pass in the function that will determine which node is called next.
    should_continue,
    # Next, we pass in the pathmap - all the possible nodes this edge could go to
    ["action", END],
)

# We now add a normal edge from `tools` to `agent`.
# This means that after `tools` is called, `agent` node is called next.
workflow.add_edge("action", "agent")

# Finally, we compile it!
# This compiles it into a LangChain Runnable,
# meaning you can use it as you would any other runnable
app = workflow.compile(checkpointer=memory)

API Reference: ChatAnthropic | tool | MemorySaver | StateGraph | START | ToolNode
from langchain_core.messages import HumanMessage

config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "2"}}
input_message = HumanMessage(content="hi! I'm bob")
for event in app.stream({"messages": [input_message]}, config, stream_mode="values"):
    event["messages"][-1].pretty_print()

# This will now not remember the previous messages
# (because we set `messages[-1:]` in the filter messages argument)
input_message = HumanMessage(content="what's my name?")
for event in app.stream({"messages": [input_message]}, config, stream_mode="values"):
    event["messages"][-1].pretty_print()

CONTENT:
How to add cross-thread persistence (functional API)¶

Prerequisites
This guide assumes familiarity with the following:

Functional API
Persistence
Memory
Chat Models

LangGraph allows you to persist data across different threads. For instance, you can store information about users (their names or preferences) in a shared (cross-thread) memory and reuse them in the new threads (e.g., new conversations).
When using the functional API, you can set it up to store and retrieve memories by using the Store interface:

Create an instance of a Store
from langgraph.store.memory import InMemoryStore, BaseStore

store = InMemoryStore()

Pass the store instance to the entrypoint() decorator and expose store parameter in the function signature:
from langgraph.func import entrypoint

@entrypoint(store=store)
def workflow(inputs: dict, store: BaseStore):
    my_task(inputs).result()
    ...

In this guide, we will show how to construct and use a workflow that has a shared memory implemented using the Store interface.

Note
Support for the Store API that is used in this guide was added in LangGraph v0.2.32.
Support for index and query arguments of the Store API that is used in this guide was added in LangGraph v0.2.54.

Note
If you need to add cross-thread persistence to a StateGraph, check out this how-to guide.

Setup¶
First, let's install the required packages and set our API keys
%%capture --no-stderr
%pip install -U langchain_anthropic langchain_openai langgraph

import getpass
import os

def _set_env(var: str):
    if not os.environ.get(var):
        os.environ[var] = getpass.getpass(f"{var}: ")

_set_env("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY")
_set_env("OPENAI_API_KEY")

Example: simple chatbot with long-term memory¶
Define store¶
In this example we will create a workflow that will be able to retrieve information about a user's preferences. We will do so by defining an InMemoryStore - an object that can store data in memory and query that data.
When storing objects using the Store interface you define two things:

the namespace for the object, a tuple (similar to directories)
the object key (similar to filenames)

In our example, we'll be using ("memories", <user_id>) as namespace and random UUID as key for each new memory.
Importantly, to determine the user, we will be passing user_id via the config keyword argument of the node function.
Let's first define our store!
from langgraph.store.memory import InMemoryStore
from langchain_openai import OpenAIEmbeddings

in_memory_store = InMemoryStore(
    index={
        "embed": OpenAIEmbeddings(model="text-embedding-3-small"),
        "dims": 1536,
    }
)

API Reference: OpenAIEmbeddings
Create workflow¶
import uuid

from langchain_anthropic import ChatAnthropic
from langchain_core.runnables import RunnableConfig
from langchain_core.messages import BaseMessage
from langgraph.func import entrypoint, task
from langgraph.graph import add_messages
from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver
from langgraph.store.base import BaseStore

model = ChatAnthropic(model="claude-3-5-sonnet-latest")

@task
def call_model(messages: list[BaseMessage], memory_store: BaseStore, user_id: str):
    namespace = ("memories", user_id)
    last_message = messages[-1]
    memories = memory_store.search(namespace, query=str(last_message.content))
    info = "\n".join([d.value["data"] for d in memories])
    system_msg = f"You are a helpful assistant talking to the user. User info: {info}"

    # Store new memories if the user asks the model to remember
    if "remember" in last_message.content.lower():
        memory = "User name is Bob"
        memory_store.put(namespace, str(uuid.uuid4()), {"data": memory})

    response = model.invoke([{"role": "system", "content": system_msg}] + messages)
    return response

# NOTE: we're passing the store object here when creating a workflow via entrypoint()
@entrypoint(checkpointer=MemorySaver(), store=in_memory_store)
def workflow(
    inputs: list[BaseMessage],
    *,
    previous: list[BaseMessage],
    config: RunnableConfig,
    store: BaseStore,
):
    user_id = config["configurable"]["user_id"]
    previous = previous or []
    inputs = add_messages(previous, inputs)
    response = call_model(inputs, store, user_id).result()
    return entrypoint.final(value=response, save=add_messages(inputs, response))

API Reference: ChatAnthropic | RunnableConfig | BaseMessage | entrypoint | task | add_messages | MemorySaver

Note
If you're using LangGraph Cloud or LangGraph Studio, you don't need to pass store to the entrypoint decorator, since it's done automatically.

Run the workflow!¶
Now let's specify a user ID in the config and tell the model our name:
config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "1", "user_id": "1"}}
input_message = {"role": "user", "content": "Hi! Remember: my name is Bob"}
for chunk in workflow.stream([input_message], config, stream_mode="values"):
    chunk.pretty_print()

==================================[1m Ai Message [0m==================================

Hello Bob! Nice to meet you. I'll remember that your name is Bob. How can I help you today?

config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "2", "user_id": "1"}}
input_message = {"role": "user", "content": "what is my name?"}
for chunk in workflow.stream([input_message], config, stream_mode="values"):
    chunk.pretty_print()

==================================[1m Ai Message [0m==================================

Your name is Bob.

We can now inspect our in-memory store and verify that we have in fact saved the memories for the user:
for memory in in_memory_store.search(("memories", "1")):
    print(memory.value)

{'data': 'User name is Bob'}

Let's now run the workflow for another user to verify that the memories about the first user are self contained:
config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "3", "user_id": "2"}}
input_message = {"role": "user", "content": "what is my name?"}
for chunk in workflow.stream([input_message], config, stream_mode="values"):
    chunk.pretty_print()

==================================[1m Ai Message [0m==================================

I don't have any information about your name. I can only see our current conversation without any prior context or personal details about you. If you'd like me to know your name, feel free to tell me!

Define the graph with persistence¶
To add persistence to a graph with subgraphs, all you need to do is pass a checkpointer when compiling the parent graph. LangGraph will automatically propagate the checkpointer to the child subgraphs.

Note
You shouldn't provide a checkpointer when compiling a subgraph. Instead, you must define a single checkpointer that you pass to parent_graph.compile(), and LangGraph will automatically propagate the checkpointer to the child subgraphs. If you pass the checkpointer to the subgraph.compile(), it will simply be ignored. This also applies when you add a node function that invokes the subgraph.

Let's define a simple graph with a single subgraph node to show how to do this.
from langgraph.graph import START, StateGraph
from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver
from typing import TypedDict

# subgraph

class SubgraphState(TypedDict):
    foo: str  # note that this key is shared with the parent graph state
    bar: str

def subgraph_node_1(state: SubgraphState):
    return {"bar": "bar"}

def subgraph_node_2(state: SubgraphState):
    # note that this node is using a state key ('bar') that is only available in the subgraph
    # and is sending update on the shared state key ('foo')
    return {"foo": state["foo"] + state["bar"]}

subgraph_builder = StateGraph(SubgraphState)
subgraph_builder.add_node(subgraph_node_1)
subgraph_builder.add_node(subgraph_node_2)
subgraph_builder.add_edge(START, "subgraph_node_1")
subgraph_builder.add_edge("subgraph_node_1", "subgraph_node_2")
subgraph = subgraph_builder.compile()

# parent graph

class State(TypedDict):
    foo: str

def node_1(state: State):
    return {"foo": "hi! " + state["foo"]}

builder = StateGraph(State)
builder.add_node("node_1", node_1)
# note that we're adding the compiled subgraph as a node to the parent graph
builder.add_node("node_2", subgraph)
builder.add_edge(START, "node_1")
builder.add_edge("node_1", "node_2")

API Reference: START | StateGraph | MemorySaver
<langgraph.graph.state.StateGraph at 0x106d2fa10>

We can now compile the graph with an in-memory checkpointer (MemorySaver).
checkpointer = MemorySaver()
# You must only pass checkpointer when compiling the parent graph.
# LangGraph will automatically propagate the checkpointer to the child subgraphs.
graph = builder.compile(checkpointer=checkpointer)

Verify persistence works¶
Let's now run the graph and inspect the persisted state for both the parent graph and the subgraph to verify that persistence works. We should expect to see the final execution results for both the parent and subgraph in state.values.
config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "1"}}

for _, chunk in graph.stream({"foo": "foo"}, config, subgraphs=True):
    print(chunk)

{'node_1': {'foo': 'hi! foo'}}
{'subgraph_node_1': {'bar': 'bar'}}
{'subgraph_node_2': {'foo': 'hi! foobar'}}
{'node_2': {'foo': 'hi! foobar'}}

We can now view the parent graph state by calling graph.get_state() with the same config that we used to invoke the graph.
graph.get_state(config).values

{'foo': 'hi! foobar'}

To view the subgraph state, we need to do two things:

Find the most recent config value for the subgraph
Use graph.get_state() to retrieve that value for the most recent subgraph config.

To find the correct config, we can examine the state history from the parent graph and find the state snapshot before we return results from node_2 (the node with subgraph):
state_with_subgraph = [
    s for s in graph.get_state_history(config) if s.next == ("node_2",)
][0]

The state snapshot will include the list of tasks to be executed next. When using subgraphs, the tasks will contain the config that we can use to retrieve the subgraph state:
subgraph_config = state_with_subgraph.tasks[0].state
subgraph_config

{'configurable': {'thread_id': '1',
  'checkpoint_ns': 'node_2:6ef111a6-f290-7376-0dfc-a4152307bc5b'}}

graph.get_state(subgraph_config).values

{'foo': 'hi! foobar', 'bar': 'bar'}

How to create a custom checkpointer using Redis¶

Prerequisites

        This guide assumes familiarity with the following:
        

                    Persistence
                

                    Redis
                

When creating LangGraph agents, you can also set them up so that they persist their state. This allows you to do things like interact with an agent multiple times and have it remember previous interactions.
This reference implementation shows how to use Redis as the backend for persisting checkpoint state. Make sure that you have Redis running on port 6379 for going through this guide.

Note

        This is a **reference** implementation. You can implement your own checkpointer using a different database or modify this one as long as it conforms to the BaseCheckpointSaver interface.
    

For demonstration purposes we add persistence to the pre-built create react agent.
In general, you can add a checkpointer to any custom graph that you build like this:
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph

builder = StateGraph(....)
# ... define the graph
checkpointer = # redis checkpointer (see examples below)
graph = builder.compile(checkpointer=checkpointer)
...

Setup¶
First, let's install the required packages and set our API keys
%%capture --no-stderr
%pip install -U redis langgraph langchain_openai

import getpass
import os

def _set_env(var: str):
    if not os.environ.get(var):
        os.environ[var] = getpass.getpass(f"{var}: ")

_set_env("OPENAI_API_KEY")

RedisSaver¶
Below is an implementation of RedisSaver (for synchronous use of graph, i.e. .invoke(), .stream()). RedisSaver implements four methods that are required for any checkpointer:

.put - Store a checkpoint with its configuration and metadata.
.put_writes - Store intermediate writes linked to a checkpoint (i.e. pending writes).
.get_tuple - Fetch a checkpoint tuple using for a given configuration (thread_id and checkpoint_id).
.list - List checkpoints that match a given configuration and filter criteria.

Below is a reference implementation of AsyncRedisSaver (for asynchronous use of graph, i.e. .ainvoke(), .astream()). AsyncRedisSaver implements four methods that are required for any async checkpointer:

.aput - Store a checkpoint with its configuration and metadata.
.aput_writes - Store intermediate writes linked to a checkpoint (i.e. pending writes).
.aget_tuple - Fetch a checkpoint tuple using for a given configuration (thread_id and checkpoint_id).
.alist - List checkpoints that match a given configuration and filter criteria.

CONTENT:
How to add cross-thread persistence to your graph¶

Prerequisites

        This guide assumes familiarity with the following:
        

                    Persistence
                

                    Memory
                

                    Chat Models
                

In the previous guide you learned how to persist graph state across multiple interactions on a single thread. LangGraph also allows you to persist data across multiple threads. For instance, you can store information about users (their names or preferences) in a shared memory and reuse them in the new conversational threads.
In this guide, we will show how to construct and use a graph that has a shared memory implemented using the Store interface.

Note

    Support for the Store API that is used in this guide was added in LangGraph v0.2.32.
    

    Support for index and query arguments of the Store API that is used in this guide was added in LangGraph v0.2.54.
    

Setup¶
First, let's install the required packages and set our API keys
%%capture --no-stderr
%pip install -U langchain_openai langgraph

import getpass
import os

def _set_env(var: str):
    if not os.environ.get(var):
        os.environ[var] = getpass.getpass(f"{var}: ")

_set_env("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY")
_set_env("OPENAI_API_KEY")

Define store¶
In this example we will create a graph that will be able to retrieve information about a user's preferences. We will do so by defining an InMemoryStore - an object that can store data in memory and query that data. We will then pass the store object when compiling the graph. This allows each node in the graph to access the store: when you define node functions, you can define store keyword argument, and LangGraph will automatically pass the store object you compiled the graph with.
When storing objects using the Store interface you define two things:

the namespace for the object, a tuple (similar to directories)
the object key (similar to filenames)

In our example, we'll be using ("memories", <user_id>) as namespace and random UUID as key for each new memory.
Importantly, to determine the user, we will be passing user_id via the config keyword argument of the node function.
Let's first define an InMemoryStore already populated with some memories about the users.
from langgraph.store.memory import InMemoryStore
from langchain_openai import OpenAIEmbeddings

in_memory_store = InMemoryStore(
    index={
        "embed": OpenAIEmbeddings(model="text-embedding-3-small"),
        "dims": 1536,
    }
)

        [{"role": "system", "content": system_msg}] + state["messages"]
    )
    return {"messages": response}

builder = StateGraph(MessagesState)
builder.add_node("call_model", call_model)
builder.add_edge(START, "call_model")

# NOTE: we're passing the store object here when compiling the graph
graph = builder.compile(checkpointer=MemorySaver(), store=in_memory_store)
# If you're using LangGraph Cloud or LangGraph Studio, you don't need to pass the store or checkpointer when compiling the graph, since it's done automatically.

Note

        If you're using LangGraph Cloud or LangGraph Studio, you don't need to pass store when compiling the graph, since it's done automatically.
    

Run the graph!¶
Now let's specify a user ID in the config and tell the model our name:
config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "1", "user_id": "1"}}
input_message = {"role": "user", "content": "Hi! Remember: my name is Bob"}
for chunk in graph.stream({"messages": [input_message]}, config, stream_mode="values"):
    chunk["messages"][-1].pretty_print()

================================[1m Human Message [0m=================================

Hi! Remember: my name is Bob
==================================[1m Ai Message [0m==================================

Hello Bob! It's nice to meet you. I'll remember that your name is Bob. How can I assist you today?

config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "2", "user_id": "1"}}
input_message = {"role": "user", "content": "what is my name?"}
for chunk in graph.stream({"messages": [input_message]}, config, stream_mode="values"):
    chunk["messages"][-1].pretty_print()

================================[1m Human Message [0m=================================

what is my name?
==================================[1m Ai Message [0m==================================

Your name is Bob.

We can now inspect our in-memory store and verify that we have in fact saved the memories for the user:
for memory in in_memory_store.search(("memories", "1")):
    print(memory.value)

{'data': 'User name is Bob'}

Let's now run the graph for another user to verify that the memories about the first user are self contained:
config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "3", "user_id": "2"}}
input_message = {"role": "user", "content": "what is my name?"}
for chunk in graph.stream({"messages": [input_message]}, config, stream_mode="values"):
    chunk["messages"][-1].pretty_print()

================================[1m Human Message [0m=================================

what is my name?
==================================[1m Ai Message [0m==================================

I apologize, but I don't have any information about your name. As an AI assistant, I don't have access to personal information about users unless it has been specifically shared in our conversation. If you'd like, you can tell me your name and I'll be happy to use it in our discussion.

How to use Postgres checkpointer for persistence¶

Prerequisites

        This guide assumes familiarity with the following:
        

                    Persistence
                

                    Postgresql
                

Not needed for LangGraph API users
If you're using the LangGraph API, you needn't manually implement a checkpointer. The API automatically handles checkpointing for you. This guide is relevant when implementing LangGraph in your own custom server.

When creating LangGraph agents, you can also set them up so that they persist their state. This allows you to do things like interact with an agent multiple times and have it remember previous interactions.
This how-to guide shows how to use Postgres as the backend for persisting checkpoint state using the langgraph-checkpoint-postgres library.
For demonstration purposes we add persistence to the pre-built create react agent. 
In general, you can add a checkpointer to any custom graph that you build like this:
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph

builder = StateGraph(....)
# ... define the graph
checkpointer = # postgres checkpointer (see examples below)
graph = builder.compile(checkpointer=checkpointer)
...

Setup
You need to run .setup() once on your checkpointer to initialize the database before you can use it.

Setup¶
You will need access to a postgres instance. There are many resources online that can help
you set up a postgres instance.
Next, let's install the required packages and set our API keys
%%capture --no-stderr
%pip install -U psycopg psycopg-pool langgraph langgraph-checkpoint-postgres

import getpass
import os

def _set_env(var: str):
    if not os.environ.get(var):
        os.environ[var] = getpass.getpass(f"{var}: ")

_set_env("OPENAI_API_KEY")

Define model and tools for the graph¶
from typing import Literal

from langchain_core.tools import tool
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from langgraph.prebuilt import create_react_agent
from langgraph.checkpoint.postgres import PostgresSaver
from langgraph.checkpoint.postgres.aio import AsyncPostgresSaver

@tool
def get_weather(city: Literal["nyc", "sf"]):
    """Use this to get weather information."""
    if city == "nyc":
        return "It might be cloudy in nyc"
    elif city == "sf":
        return "It's always sunny in sf"
    else:
        raise AssertionError("Unknown city")

tools = [get_weather]
model = ChatOpenAI(model_name="gpt-4o-mini", temperature=0)

API Reference: tool | ChatOpenAI | create_react_agent | PostgresSaver | AsyncPostgresSaver
Use sync connection¶
This sets up a synchronous connection to the database. 
Synchronous connections execute operations in a blocking manner, meaning each operation waits for completion before moving to the next one. The DB_URI is the database connection URI, with the protocol used for connecting to a PostgreSQL database, authentication, and host where database is running. The connection_kwargs dictionary defines additional parameters for the database connection.
DB_URI = "postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5442/postgres?sslmode=disable"

connection_kwargs = {
    "autocommit": True,
    "prepare_threshold": 0,
}

With a connection pool¶
This manages a pool of reusable database connections: 
- Advantages: Efficient resource utilization, improved performance for frequent connections
- Best for: Applications with many short-lived database operations
from psycopg_pool import ConnectionPool

with ConnectionPool(
    # Example configuration
    conninfo=DB_URI,
    max_size=20,
    kwargs=connection_kwargs,
) as pool:
    checkpointer = PostgresSaver(pool)

    # NOTE: you need to call .setup() the first time you're using your checkpointer
    checkpointer.setup()

    graph = create_react_agent(model, tools=tools, checkpointer=checkpointer)
    config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "1"}}
    res = graph.invoke({"messages": [("human", "what's the weather in sf")]}, config)
    checkpoint = checkpointer.get(config)

Use async connection¶
This sets up an asynchronous connection to the database. 
Async connections allow non-blocking database operations. This means other parts of your application can continue running while waiting for database operations to complete. It's particularly useful in high-concurrency scenarios or when dealing with I/O-bound operations.
With a connection pool¶
from psycopg_pool import AsyncConnectionPool

async with AsyncConnectionPool(
    # Example configuration
    conninfo=DB_URI,
    max_size=20,
    kwargs=connection_kwargs,
) as pool:
    checkpointer = AsyncPostgresSaver(pool)

    # NOTE: you need to call .setup() the first time you're using your checkpointer
    await checkpointer.setup()

    graph = create_react_agent(model, tools=tools, checkpointer=checkpointer)
    config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "4"}}
    res = await graph.ainvoke(
        {"messages": [("human", "what's the weather in nyc")]}, config
    )

    checkpoint = await checkpointer.aget(config)

How to add thread-level persistence (functional API)¶

Prerequisites
This guide assumes familiarity with the following:

Functional API
Persistence
Memory
Chat Models

Not needed for LangGraph API users
If you're using the LangGraph API, you needn't manually implement a checkpointer. The API automatically handles checkpointing for you. This guide is relevant when implementing LangGraph in your own custom server.

Many AI applications need memory to share context across multiple interactions on the same thread (e.g., multiple turns of a conversation). In LangGraph functional API, this kind of memory can be added to any entrypoint() workflow using thread-level persistence.
When creating a LangGraph workflow, you can set it up to persist its results by using a checkpointer:

Create an instance of a checkpointer:
from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver

checkpointer = MemorySaver()       

Pass checkpointer instance to the entrypoint() decorator:
from langgraph.func import entrypoint

@entrypoint(checkpointer=checkpointer)
def workflow(inputs)
    ...

Optionally expose previous parameter in the workflow function signature:
@entrypoint(checkpointer=checkpointer)
def workflow(
    inputs,
    *,
    # you can optionally specify `previous` in the workflow function signature
    # to access the return value from the workflow as of the last execution
    previous
):
    previous = previous or []
    combined_inputs = previous + inputs
    result = do_something(combined_inputs)
    ...

Optionally choose which values will be returned from the workflow and which will be saved by the checkpointer as previous:
@entrypoint(checkpointer=checkpointer)
def workflow(inputs, *, previous):
    ...
    result = do_something(...)
    return entrypoint.final(value=result, save=combine(inputs, result))

This guide shows how you can add thread-level persistence to your workflow.

Note
If you need memory that is shared across multiple conversations or users (cross-thread persistence), check out this how-to guide.

Note
If you need to add thread-level persistence to a StateGraph, check out this how-to guide.

Setup¶
First we need to install the packages required
%%capture --no-stderr
%pip install --quiet -U langgraph langchain_anthropic

Next, we need to set API key for Anthropic (the LLM we will use).
import getpass
import os

def _set_env(var: str):
    if not os.environ.get(var):
        os.environ[var] = getpass.getpass(f"{var}: ")

_set_env("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY")

Example: simple chatbot with short-term memory¶
We will be using a workflow with a single task that calls a chat model.
Let's first define the model we'll be using:
from langchain_anthropic import ChatAnthropic

model = ChatAnthropic(model="claude-3-5-sonnet-latest")

API Reference: ChatAnthropic
Now we can define our task and workflow. To add in persistence, we need to pass in a Checkpointer to the entrypoint() decorator.
from langchain_core.messages import BaseMessage
from langgraph.graph import add_messages
from langgraph.func import entrypoint, task
from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver

@task
def call_model(messages: list[BaseMessage]):
    response = model.invoke(messages)
    return response

checkpointer = MemorySaver()

@entrypoint(checkpointer=checkpointer)
def workflow(inputs: list[BaseMessage], *, previous: list[BaseMessage]):
    if previous:
        inputs = add_messages(previous, inputs)

If we try to use this workflow, the context of the conversation will be persisted across interactions:

Note
If you're using LangGraph Cloud or LangGraph Studio, you don't need to pass checkpointer to the entrypoint decorator, since it's done automatically.

We can now interact with the agent and see that it remembers previous messages!
config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "1"}}
input_message = {"role": "user", "content": "hi! I'm bob"}
for chunk in workflow.stream([input_message], config, stream_mode="values"):
    chunk.pretty_print()

==================================[1m Ai Message [0m==================================

Hi Bob! I'm Claude. Nice to meet you! How are you today?

You can always resume previous threads:
input_message = {"role": "user", "content": "what's my name?"}
for chunk in workflow.stream([input_message], config, stream_mode="values"):
    chunk.pretty_print()

==================================[1m Ai Message [0m==================================

Your name is Bob.

If we want to start a new conversation, we can pass in a different thread_id. Poof! All the memories are gone!
input_message = {"role": "user", "content": "what's my name?"}
for chunk in workflow.stream(
    [input_message],
    {"configurable": {"thread_id": "2"}},
    stream_mode="values",
):
    chunk.pretty_print()

==================================[1m Ai Message [0m==================================

I don't know your name unless you tell me. Each conversation I have starts fresh, so I don't have access to any previous interactions or personal information unless you share it with me.

Streaming tokens
If you would like to stream LLM tokens from your chatbot, you can use stream_mode="messages". Check out this how-to guide to learn more.

How to use MongoDB checkpointer for persistence¶

Prerequisites

        This guide assumes familiarity with the following:
        

                    Persistence
                

                    MongoDB
                

When creating LangGraph agents, you can also set them up so that they persist their state. This allows you to do things like interact with an agent multiple times and have it remember previous interactions. 
This reference implementation shows how to use MongoDB as the backend for persisting checkpoint state using the langgraph-checkpoint-mongodb library.
For demonstration purposes we add persistence to a prebuilt ReAct agent.
In general, you can add a checkpointer to any custom graph that you build like this:
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph

builder = StateGraph(...)
# ... define the graph
checkpointer = # mongodb checkpointer (see examples below)
graph = builder.compile(checkpointer=checkpointer)
...

Setup¶
To use the MongoDB checkpointer, you will need a MongoDB cluster. Follow this guide to create a cluster if you don't already have one.
Next, let's install the required packages and set our API keys
%%capture --no-stderr
%pip install -U pymongo langgraph langgraph-checkpoint-mongodb

import getpass
import os

def _set_env(var: str):
    if not os.environ.get(var):
        os.environ[var] = getpass.getpass(f"{var}: ")

_set_env("OPENAI_API_KEY")

Define model and tools for the graph¶
from typing import Literal

from langchain_core.tools import tool
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from langgraph.prebuilt import create_react_agent

@tool
def get_weather(city: Literal["nyc", "sf"]):
    """Use this to get weather information."""
    if city == "nyc":
        return "It might be cloudy in nyc"
    elif city == "sf":
        return "It's always sunny in sf"
    else:
        raise AssertionError("Unknown city")

tools = [get_weather]
model = ChatOpenAI(model_name="gpt-4o-mini", temperature=0)

API Reference: tool | ChatOpenAI | create_react_agent
MongoDB checkpointer usage¶
With a connection string¶
This creates a connection to MongoDB directly using the connection string of your cluster. This is ideal for use in scripts, one-off operations and short-lived applications.
from langgraph.checkpoint.mongodb import MongoDBSaver

MONGODB_URI = "localhost:27017"  # replace this with your connection string

with MongoDBSaver.from_conn_string(MONGODB_URI) as checkpointer:
    graph = create_react_agent(model, tools=tools, checkpointer=checkpointer)
    config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "1"}}
    response = graph.invoke(
        {"messages": [("human", "what's the weather in sf")]}, config
    )

response

{'messages': [HumanMessage(content="what's the weather in sf", additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id='729afd6a-fdc0-4192-a255-1dac065c79b2'),
  AIMessage(content='', additional_kwargs={'tool_calls': [{'id': 'call_YqaO8oU3BhGmIz9VHTxqGyyN', 'function': {'arguments': '{"city":"sf"}', 'name': 'get_weather'}, 'type': 'function'}], 'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 14, 'prompt_tokens': 57, 'total_tokens': 71, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 0}}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_39a40c96a0', 'finish_reason': 'tool_calls', 'logprobs': None}, id='run-b45c0c12-c68e-4392-92dd-5d325d0a9f60-0', tool_calls=[{'name': 'get_weather', 'args': {'city': 'sf'}, 'id': 'call_YqaO8oU3BhGmIz9VHTxqGyyN', 'type': 'tool_call'}], usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 57, 'output_tokens': 14, 'total_tokens': 71, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 0}}),

Using the MongoDB client¶
This creates a connection to MongoDB using the MongoDB client. This is ideal for long-running applications since it allows you to reuse the client instance for multiple database operations without needing to reinitialize the connection each time.
from pymongo import MongoClient

mongodb_client = MongoClient(MONGODB_URI)

checkpointer = MongoDBSaver(mongodb_client)
graph = create_react_agent(model, tools=tools, checkpointer=checkpointer)
config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "2"}}
response = graph.invoke({"messages": [("user", "What's the weather in sf?")]}, config)

# Retrieve the latest checkpoint for the given thread ID

# Remember to close the connection after you're done
mongodb_client.close()

Using an async connection¶
This creates a short-lived asynchronous connection to MongoDB. 
Async connections allow non-blocking database operations. This means other parts of your application can continue running while waiting for database operations to complete. It's particularly useful in high-concurrency scenarios or when dealing with I/O-bound operations.
from langgraph.checkpoint.mongodb.aio import AsyncMongoDBSaver

async with AsyncMongoDBSaver.from_conn_string(MONGODB_URI) as checkpointer:
    graph = create_react_agent(model, tools=tools, checkpointer=checkpointer)
    config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "3"}}
    response = await graph.ainvoke(
        {"messages": [("user", "What's the weather in sf?")]}, config
    )

How to add cross-thread persistence to your graph¶

Prerequisites

        This guide assumes familiarity with the following:
        

                    Persistence
                

                    Memory
                

                    Chat Models
                

In the previous guide you learned how to persist graph state across multiple interactions on a single thread. LangGraph also allows you to persist data across multiple threads. For instance, you can store information about users (their names or preferences) in a shared memory and reuse them in the new conversational threads.
In this guide, we will show how to construct and use a graph that has a shared memory implemented using the Store interface.

Note

    Support for the Store API that is used in this guide was added in LangGraph v0.2.32.
    

    Support for index and query arguments of the Store API that is used in this guide was added in LangGraph v0.2.54.
    

Setup¶
First, let's install the required packages and set our API keys
%%capture --no-stderr
%pip install -U langchain_openai langgraph

import getpass
import os

def _set_env(var: str):
    if not os.environ.get(var):
        os.environ[var] = getpass.getpass(f"{var}: ")

_set_env("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY")
_set_env("OPENAI_API_KEY")

Define store¶
In this example we will create a graph that will be able to retrieve information about a user's preferences. We will do so by defining an InMemoryStore - an object that can store data in memory and query that data. We will then pass the store object when compiling the graph. This allows each node in the graph to access the store: when you define node functions, you can define store keyword argument, and LangGraph will automatically pass the store object you compiled the graph with.
When storing objects using the Store interface you define two things:

the namespace for the object, a tuple (similar to directories)
the object key (similar to filenames)

In our example, we'll be using ("memories", <user_id>) as namespace and random UUID as key for each new memory.
Importantly, to determine the user, we will be passing user_id via the config keyword argument of the node function.
Let's first define an InMemoryStore already populated with some memories about the users.
from langgraph.store.memory import InMemoryStore
from langchain_openai import OpenAIEmbeddings

in_memory_store = InMemoryStore(
    index={
        "embed": OpenAIEmbeddings(model="text-embedding-3-small"),
        "dims": 1536,
    }
)

API Reference: OpenAIEmbeddings
Create graph¶
import uuid
from typing import Annotated
from typing_extensions import TypedDict

from langchain_anthropic import ChatAnthropic
from langchain_core.runnables import RunnableConfig
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, MessagesState, START
from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver
from langgraph.store.base import BaseStore

model = ChatAnthropic(model="claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620")

# NOTE: we're passing the Store param to the node --
# this is the Store we compile the graph with
def call_model(state: MessagesState, config: RunnableConfig, *, store: BaseStore):
    user_id = config["configurable"]["user_id"]
    namespace = ("memories", user_id)
    memories = store.search(namespace, query=str(state["messages"][-1].content))
    info = "\n".join([d.value["data"] for d in memories])
    system_msg = f"You are a helpful assistant talking to the user. User info: {info}"

    # Store new memories if the user asks the model to remember
    last_message = state["messages"][-1]
    if "remember" in last_message.content.lower():
        memory = "User name is Bob"
        store.put(namespace, str(uuid.uuid4()), {"data": memory})

    response = model.invoke(
        [{"role": "system", "content": system_msg}] + state["messages"]
    )
    return {"messages": response}

builder = StateGraph(MessagesState)
builder.add_node("call_model", call_model)
builder.add_edge(START, "call_model")

# NOTE: we're passing the store object here when compiling the graph
graph = builder.compile(checkpointer=MemorySaver(), store=in_memory_store)
# If you're using LangGraph Cloud or LangGraph Studio, you don't need to pass the store or checkpointer when compiling the graph, since it's done automatically.

API Reference: ChatAnthropic | RunnableConfig | StateGraph | START | MemorySaver

Note

        If you're using LangGraph Cloud or LangGraph Studio, you don't need to pass store when compiling the graph, since it's done automatically.
    

Run the graph!¶
Now let's specify a user ID in the config and tell the model our name:
config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "1", "user_id": "1"}}
input_message = {"role": "user", "content": "Hi! Remember: my name is Bob"}
for chunk in graph.stream({"messages": [input_message]}, config, stream_mode="values"):
    chunk["messages"][-1].pretty_print()

================================[1m Human Message [0m=================================

Hi! Remember: my name is Bob
==================================[1m Ai Message [0m==================================

Hello Bob! It's nice to meet you. I'll remember that your name is Bob. How can I assist you today?

config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "2", "user_id": "1"}}
input_message = {"role": "user", "content": "what is my name?"}
for chunk in graph.stream({"messages": [input_message]}, config, stream_mode="values"):
    chunk["messages"][-1].pretty_print()

================================[1m Human Message [0m=================================

what is my name?
==================================[1m Ai Message [0m==================================

Your name is Bob.

We can now inspect our in-memory store and verify that we have in fact saved the memories for the user:
for memory in in_memory_store.search(("memories", "1")):
    print(memory.value)

{'data': 'User name is Bob'}

Let's now run the graph for another user to verify that the memories about the first user are self contained:
config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "3", "user_id": "2"}}
input_message = {"role": "user", "content": "what is my name?"}
for chunk in graph.stream({"messages": [input_message]}, config, stream_mode="values"):
    chunk["messages"][-1].pretty_print()

================================[1m Human Message [0m=================================

what is my name?
==================================[1m Ai Message [0m==================================

I apologize, but I don't have any information about your name. As an AI assistant, I don't have access to personal information about users unless it has been specifically shared in our conversation. If you'd like, you can tell me your name and I'll be happy to use it in our discussion.

How to add thread-level persistence to your graph¶

Prerequisites

        This guide assumes familiarity with the following:
        

                    Persistence
                

                    Memory
                

                    Chat Models
                

Not needed for LangGraph API users
If you're using the LangGraph API, you needn't manually implement a checkpointer. The API automatically handles checkpointing for you. This guide is relevant when implementing LangGraph in your own custom server.

Many AI applications need memory to share context across multiple interactions. In LangGraph, this kind of memory can be added to any StateGraph using thread-level persistence .
When creating any LangGraph graph, you can set it up to persist its state by adding a checkpointer when compiling the graph:
from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver

checkpointer = MemorySaver()
graph.compile(checkpointer=checkpointer)

API Reference: MemorySaver
This guide shows how you can add thread-level persistence to your graph.

Note

        If you need memory that is shared across multiple conversations or users (cross-thread persistence), check out this how-to guide.
    

Setup¶
First we need to install the packages required
%%capture --no-stderr
%pip install --quiet -U langgraph langchain_anthropic

Next, we need to set API key for Anthropic (the LLM we will use).
import getpass
import os

def _set_env(var: str):
    if not os.environ.get(var):
        os.environ[var] = getpass.getpass(f"{var}: ")

_set_env("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY")

Define graph¶
We will be using a single-node graph that calls a chat model.
Let's first define the model we'll be using:
from langchain_anthropic import ChatAnthropic

model = ChatAnthropic(model="claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620")

API Reference: ChatAnthropic
Now we can define our StateGraph and add our model-calling node:
from typing import Annotated
from typing_extensions import TypedDict

from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, MessagesState, START

def call_model(state: MessagesState):
    response = model.invoke(state["messages"])
    return {"messages": response}

builder = StateGraph(MessagesState)
builder.add_node("call_model", call_model)
builder.add_edge(START, "call_model")
graph = builder.compile()

API Reference: StateGraph | START
If we try to use this graph, the context of the conversation will not be persisted across interactions:
input_message = {"role": "user", "content": "hi! I'm bob"}
for chunk in graph.stream({"messages": [input_message]}, stream_mode="values"):
    chunk["messages"][-1].pretty_print()

input_message = {"role": "user", "content": "what's my name?"}
for chunk in graph.stream({"messages": [input_message]}, stream_mode="values"):
    chunk["messages"][-1].pretty_print()

================================[1m Human Message [0m=================================

hi! I'm bob
==================================[1m Ai Message [0m==================================

Hello Bob! It's nice to meet you. How are you doing today? Is there anything I can help you with or would you like to chat about something in particular?
================================[1m Human Message [0m=================================

what's my name?
==================================[1m Ai Message [0m==================================

I apologize, but I don't have access to your personal information, including your name. I'm an AI language model designed to provide general information and answer questions to the best of my ability based on my training data. I don't have any information about individual users or their personal details. If you'd like to share your name, you're welcome to do so, but I won't be able to recall it in future conversations.

Add persistence¶
To add in persistence, we need to pass in a Checkpointer when compiling the graph.
from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver

memory = MemorySaver()
graph = builder.compile(checkpointer=memory)
# If you're using LangGraph Cloud or LangGraph Studio, you don't need to pass the checkpointer when compiling the graph, since it's done automatically.

API Reference: MemorySaver

Note

        If you're using LangGraph Cloud or LangGraph Studio, you don't need to pass checkpointer when compiling the graph, since it's done automatically.
    

We can now interact with the agent and see that it remembers previous messages!
config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "1"}}
input_message = {"role": "user", "content": "hi! I'm bob"}
for chunk in graph.stream({"messages": [input_message]}, config, stream_mode="values"):
    chunk["messages"][-1].pretty_print()

================================[1m Human Message [0m=================================

hi! I'm bob
==================================[1m Ai Message [0m==================================

Hello Bob! It's nice to meet you. How are you doing today? Is there anything in particular you'd like to chat about or any questions you have that I can help you with?

You can always resume previous threads:
input_message = {"role": "user", "content": "what's my name?"}
for chunk in graph.stream({"messages": [input_message]}, config, stream_mode="values"):
    chunk["messages"][-1].pretty_print()

================================[1m Human Message [0m=================================

what's my name?
==================================[1m Ai Message [0m==================================

Your name is Bob, as you introduced yourself at the beginning of our conversation.

If we want to start a new conversation, we can pass in a different thread_id. Poof! All the memories are gone!
input_message = {"role": "user", "content": "what's my name?"}
for chunk in graph.stream(
    {"messages": [input_message]},
    {"configurable": {"thread_id": "2"}},
    stream_mode="values",
):
    chunk["messages"][-1].pretty_print()

================================[1m Human Message [0m=================================

what's is my name?
==================================[1m Ai Message [0m==================================

I apologize, but I don't have access to your personal information, including your name. As an AI language model, I don't have any information about individual users unless it's provided within the conversation. If you'd like to share your name, you're welcome to do so, but otherwise, I won't be able to know or guess it.

DOCUMENT 94
SOURCE: https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/how-tos/memory/delete-messages/
CONTENT:
How to delete messages¶
One of the common states for a graph is a list of messages. Usually you only add messages to that state. However, sometimes you may want to remove messages (either by directly modifying the state or as part of the graph). To do that, you can use the RemoveMessage modifier. In this guide, we will cover how to do that.
The key idea is that each state key has a reducer key. This key specifies how to combine updates to the state. The default MessagesState has a messages key, and the reducer for that key accepts these RemoveMessage modifiers. That reducer then uses these RemoveMessage to delete messages from the key.
So note that just because your graph state has a key that is a list of messages, it doesn't mean that that this RemoveMessage modifier will work. You also have to have a reducer defined that knows how to work with this.
NOTE: Many models expect certain rules around lists of messages. For example, some expect them to start with a user message, others expect all messages with tool calls to be followed by a tool message. When deleting messages, you will want to make sure you don't violate these rules.
Setup¶
First, let's build a simple graph that uses messages. Note that it's using the MessagesState which has the required reducer.
%%capture --no-stderr
%pip install --quiet -U langgraph langchain_anthropic

Next, we need to set API keys for Anthropic (the LLM we will use)
import getpass

def _set_env(var: str):
    if not os.environ.get(var):
        os.environ[var] = getpass.getpass(f"{var}: ")

Build the agent¶
Let's now build a simple ReAct style agent.
from typing import Literal

from langchain_core.tools import tool

from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver
from langgraph.graph import MessagesState, StateGraph, START, END

    # This is a placeholder for the actual implementation
    # Don't let the LLM know this though 😊

    last_message = state["messages"][-1]
    # If there is no function call, then we finish
    if not last_message.tool_calls:
        return END
    # Otherwise if there is, we continue
    return "action"

# Define the function that calls the model
def call_model(state: MessagesState):
    response = model.invoke(state["messages"])
    # We return a list, because this will get added to the existing list
    return {"messages": response}

# Define a new graph
workflow = StateGraph(MessagesState)

# Define the two nodes we will cycle between
workflow.add_node("agent", call_model)
workflow.add_node("action", tool_node)

# Set the entrypoint as `agent`
# This means that this node is the first one called
workflow.add_edge(START, "agent")

# We now add a conditional edge
workflow.add_conditional_edges(
    # First, we define the start node. We use `agent`.
    # This means these are the edges taken after the `agent` node is called.
    "agent",
    # Next, we pass in the function that will determine which node is called next.
    should_continue,
    # Next, we pass in the path map - all the possible nodes this edge could go to
    ["action", END],
)

# We now add a normal edge from `tools` to `agent`.
# This means that after `tools` is called, `agent` node is called next.
workflow.add_edge("action", "agent")

# Finally, we compile it!
# This compiles it into a LangChain Runnable,
# meaning you can use it as you would any other runnable
app = workflow.compile(checkpointer=memory)

We can call update_state and pass in the id of the first message. This will delete that message.
from langchain_core.messages import RemoveMessage

app.update_state(config, {"messages": RemoveMessage(id=messages[0].id)})

API Reference: RemoveMessage

  'checkpoint_ns': '',
  'checkpoint_id': '1ef75157-f251-6a2a-8005-82a86a6593a0'}}

If we now look at the messages, we can verify that the first one was deleted.
messages = app.get_state(config).values["messages"]
messages

Programmatically deleting messages¶
We can also delete messages programmatically from inside the graph. Here we'll modify the graph to delete any old messages (longer than 3 messages ago) at the end of a graph run.
from langchain_core.messages import RemoveMessage
from langgraph.graph import END

def delete_messages(state):
    messages = state["messages"]
    if len(messages) > 3:
        return {"messages": [RemoveMessage(id=m.id) for m in messages[:-3]]}

# We need to modify the logic to call delete_messages rather than end right away
def should_continue(state: MessagesState) -> Literal["action", "delete_messages"]:
    """Return the next node to execute."""
    last_message = state["messages"][-1]
    # If there is no function call, then we call our delete_messages function
    if not last_message.tool_calls:
        return "delete_messages"
    # Otherwise if there is, we continue
    return "action"

# Define a new graph
workflow = StateGraph(MessagesState)
workflow.add_node("agent", call_model)
workflow.add_node("action", tool_node)

# This is our new node we're defining
workflow.add_node(delete_messages)

workflow.add_edge(START, "agent")
workflow.add_conditional_edges(
    "agent",
    should_continue,
)
workflow.add_edge("action", "agent")

# This is the new edge we're adding: after we delete messages, we finish
workflow.add_edge("delete_messages", END)
app = workflow.compile(checkpointer=memory)

API Reference: RemoveMessage | END
We can now try this out. We can call the graph twice and then check the state
from langchain_core.messages import HumanMessage

config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "3"}}
input_message = HumanMessage(content="hi! I'm bob")
for event in app.stream({"messages": [input_message]}, config, stream_mode="values"):
    print([(message.type, message.content) for message in event["messages"]])

input_message = HumanMessage(content="what's my name?")

Remember, when deleting messages you will want to make sure that the remaining message list is still valid. This message list may actually not be - this is because it currently starts with an AI message, which some models do not allow.

CONTENT:
How to delete messages¶
One of the common states for a graph is a list of messages. Usually you only add messages to that state. However, sometimes you may want to remove messages (either by directly modifying the state or as part of the graph). To do that, you can use the RemoveMessage modifier. In this guide, we will cover how to do that.
The key idea is that each state key has a reducer key. This key specifies how to combine updates to the state. The default MessagesState has a messages key, and the reducer for that key accepts these RemoveMessage modifiers. That reducer then uses these RemoveMessage to delete messages from the key.
So note that just because your graph state has a key that is a list of messages, it doesn't mean that that this RemoveMessage modifier will work. You also have to have a reducer defined that knows how to work with this.
NOTE: Many models expect certain rules around lists of messages. For example, some expect them to start with a user message, others expect all messages with tool calls to be followed by a tool message. When deleting messages, you will want to make sure you don't violate these rules.
Setup¶
First, let's build a simple graph that uses messages. Note that it's using the MessagesState which has the required reducer.
%%capture --no-stderr
%pip install --quiet -U langgraph langchain_anthropic

Next, we need to set API keys for Anthropic (the LLM we will use)
import getpass
import os

def _set_env(var: str):
    if not os.environ.get(var):
        os.environ[var] = getpass.getpass(f"{var}: ")

_set_env("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY")

ANTHROPIC_API_KEY:  ········

        Sign up for LangSmith to quickly spot issues and improve the performance of your LangGraph projects. LangSmith lets you use trace data to debug, test, and monitor your LLM apps built with LangGraph — read more about how to get started here. 
    

Build the agent¶
Let's now build a simple ReAct style agent.
from typing import Literal

from langchain_anthropic import ChatAnthropic
from langchain_core.tools import tool

from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver
from langgraph.graph import MessagesState, StateGraph, START, END
from langgraph.prebuilt import ToolNode

memory = MemorySaver()

@tool
def search(query: str):
    """Call to surf the web."""
    # This is a placeholder for the actual implementation
    # Don't let the LLM know this though 😊
    return "It's sunny in San Francisco, but you better look out if you're a Gemini 😈."

tools = [search]
tool_node = ToolNode(tools)
model = ChatAnthropic(model_name="claude-3-haiku-20240307")
bound_model = model.bind_tools(tools)

def should_continue(state: MessagesState):
    """Return the next node to execute."""
    last_message = state["messages"][-1]
    # If there is no function call, then we finish
    if not last_message.tool_calls:
        return END
    # Otherwise if there is, we continue
    return "action"

# Define the function that calls the model
def call_model(state: MessagesState):
    response = model.invoke(state["messages"])
    # We return a list, because this will get added to the existing list
    return {"messages": response}

# Define a new graph
workflow = StateGraph(MessagesState)

# Define the two nodes we will cycle between
workflow.add_node("agent", call_model)
workflow.add_node("action", tool_node)

# Set the entrypoint as `agent`
# This means that this node is the first one called
workflow.add_edge(START, "agent")

# We now add a conditional edge
workflow.add_conditional_edges(
    # First, we define the start node. We use `agent`.
    # This means these are the edges taken after the `agent` node is called.
    "agent",
    # Next, we pass in the function that will determine which node is called next.
    should_continue,
    # Next, we pass in the path map - all the possible nodes this edge could go to
    ["action", END],
)

# We now add a normal edge from `tools` to `agent`.
# This means that after `tools` is called, `agent` node is called next.
workflow.add_edge("action", "agent")

# Finally, we compile it!
# This compiles it into a LangChain Runnable,
# meaning you can use it as you would any other runnable
app = workflow.compile(checkpointer=memory)

Manually deleting messages¶
First, we will cover how to manually delete messages. Let's take a look at the current state of the thread:
messages = app.get_state(config).values["messages"]
messages

[HumanMessage(content="hi! I'm bob", additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id='db576005-3a60-4b3b-8925-dc602ac1c571'),
 AIMessage(content="It's nice to meet you, Bob! I'm an AI assistant created by Anthropic. I'm here to help out with any questions or tasks you might have. Please let me know if there's anything I can assist you with.", additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={'id': 'msg_01BKAnYxmoC6bQ9PpCuHk8ZT', 'model': 'claude-3-haiku-20240307', 'stop_reason': 'end_turn', 'stop_sequence': None, 'usage': {'input_tokens': 12, 'output_tokens': 52}}, id='run-3a60c536-b207-4c56-98f3-03f94d49a9e4-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 12, 'output_tokens': 52, 'total_tokens': 64}),
 HumanMessage(content="what's my name?", additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id='2088c465-400b-430b-ad80-fad47dc1f2d6'),

We can call update_state and pass in the id of the first message. This will delete that message.
from langchain_core.messages import RemoveMessage

app.update_state(config, {"messages": RemoveMessage(id=messages[0].id)})

If we now look at the messages, we can verify that the first one was deleted.
messages = app.get_state(config).values["messages"]

Programmatically deleting messages¶
We can also delete messages programmatically from inside the graph. Here we'll modify the graph to delete any old messages (longer than 3 messages ago) at the end of a graph run.
from langchain_core.messages import RemoveMessage
from langgraph.graph import END

def delete_messages(state):

    if len(messages) > 3:
        return {"messages": [RemoveMessage(id=m.id) for m in messages[:-3]]}

    last_message = state["messages"][-1]
    # If there is no function call, then we call our delete_messages function
    if not last_message.tool_calls:
        return "delete_messages"
    # Otherwise if there is, we continue
    return "action"

# Define a new graph
workflow = StateGraph(MessagesState)
workflow.add_node("agent", call_model)
workflow.add_node("action", tool_node)

# This is our new node we're defining
workflow.add_node(delete_messages)

workflow.add_edge(START, "agent")
workflow.add_conditional_edges(

How to interact with the deployment using RemoteGraph¶

Prerequisites

LangGraph Platform
LangGraph Server

RemoteGraph is an interface that allows you to interact with your LangGraph Platform deployment as if it were a regular, locally-defined LangGraph graph (e.g. a CompiledGraph). This guide shows you how you can initialize a RemoteGraph and interact with it.
Initializing the graph¶
When initializing a RemoteGraph, you must always specify:

name: the name of the graph you want to interact with. This is the same graph name you use in langgraph.json configuration file for your deployment. 
api_key: a valid LangSmith API key. Can be set as an environment variable (LANGSMITH_API_KEY) or passed directly via the api_key argument. The API key could also be provided via the client / sync_client arguments, if LangGraphClient / SyncLangGraphClient were initialized with api_key argument.

Additionally, you have to provide one of the following:

url: URL of the deployment you want to interact with. If you pass url argument, both sync and async clients will be created using the provided URL, headers (if provided) and default configuration values (e.g. timeout, etc).
client: a LangGraphClient instance for interacting with the deployment asynchronously (e.g. using .astream(), .ainvoke(), .aget_state(), .aupdate_state(), etc.)
sync_client: a SyncLangGraphClient instance for interacting with the deployment synchronously (e.g. using .stream(), .invoke(), .get_state(), .update_state(), etc.)

Note
If you pass both client or sync_client as well as url argument, they will take precedence over the url argument. If none of the client / sync_client / url arguments are provided, RemoteGraph will raise a ValueError at runtime.

Using URL¶
PythonJavaScript

from langgraph.pregel.remote import RemoteGraph

url = <DEPLOYMENT_URL>
graph_name = "agent"
remote_graph = RemoteGraph(graph_name, url=url)

import { RemoteGraph } from "@langchain/langgraph/remote";

const url = `<DEPLOYMENT_URL>`;
const graphName = "agent";
const remoteGraph = new RemoteGraph({ graphId: graphName, url });

Using clients¶
PythonJavaScript

from langgraph_sdk import get_client, get_sync_client
from langgraph.pregel.remote import RemoteGraph

url = <DEPLOYMENT_URL>
graph_name = "agent"
client = get_client(url=url)
sync_client = get_sync_client(url=url)
remote_graph = RemoteGraph(graph_name, client=client, sync_client=sync_client)

import { Client } from "@langchain/langgraph-sdk";
import { RemoteGraph } from "@langchain/langgraph/remote";

const client = new Client({ apiUrl: `<DEPLOYMENT_URL>` });
const graphName = "agent";
const remoteGraph = new RemoteGraph({ graphId: graphName, client });

Invoking the graph¶
Since RemoteGraph is a Runnable that implements the same methods as CompiledGraph, you can interact with it the same way you normally would with a compiled graph, i.e. by calling .invoke(), .stream(), .get_state(), .update_state(), etc (as well as their async counterparts).
Asynchronously¶

Note
To use the graph asynchronously, you must provide either the url or client when initializing the RemoteGraph.

PythonJavaScript

# invoke the graph
result = await remote_graph.ainvoke({
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "what's the weather in sf"}]
})

# stream outputs from the graph
async for chunk in remote_graph.astream({
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "what's the weather in la"}]
}):
    print(chunk)

// invoke the graph
const result = await remoteGraph.invoke({
    messages: [{role: "user", content: "what's the weather in sf"}]
})

// stream outputs from the graph
for await (const chunk of await remoteGraph.stream({
    messages: [{role: "user", content: "what's the weather in la"}]
})):
    console.log(chunk)

Synchronously¶

Note
To use the graph synchronously, you must provide either the url or sync_client when initializing the RemoteGraph.

Python

# invoke the graph
result = remote_graph.invoke({
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "what's the weather in sf"}]
})

# stream outputs from the graph
for chunk in remote_graph.stream({
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "what's the weather in la"}]
}):
    print(chunk)

Thread-level persistence¶
By default, the graph runs (i.e. .invoke() or .stream() invocations) are stateless - the checkpoints and the final state of the graph are not persisted. If you would like to persist the outputs of the graph run (for example, to enable human-in-the-loop features), you can create a thread and provide the thread ID via the config argument, same as you would with a regular compiled graph:
PythonJavaScript

from langgraph_sdk import get_sync_client
url = <DEPLOYMENT_URL>
graph_name = "agent"
sync_client = get_sync_client(url=url)
remote_graph = RemoteGraph(graph_name, url=url)

# create a thread (or use an existing thread instead)
thread = sync_client.threads.create()

# invoke the graph with the thread config
config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": thread["thread_id"]}}
result = remote_graph.invoke({
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "what's the weather in sf"}]
}, config=config)

# verify that the state was persisted to the thread
thread_state = remote_graph.get_state(config)
print(thread_state)

import { Client } from "@langchain/langgraph-sdk";
import { RemoteGraph } from "@langchain/langgraph/remote";

const url = `<DEPLOYMENT_URL>`;
const graphName = "agent";
const client = new Client({ apiUrl: url });
const remoteGraph = new RemoteGraph({ graphId: graphName, url });

// create a thread (or use an existing thread instead)
const thread = await client.threads.create();

// invoke the graph with the thread config
const config = { configurable: { thread_id: thread.thread_id }};
const result = await remoteGraph.invoke({
  messages: [{ role: "user", content: "what's the weather in sf" }],
}, config);

// verify that the state was persisted to the thread
const threadState = await remoteGraph.getState(config);
console.log(threadState);

Using as a subgraph¶

Note
If you need to use a checkpointer with a graph that has a RemoteGraph subgraph node, make sure to use UUIDs as thread IDs.

Since the RemoteGraph behaves the same way as a regular CompiledGraph, it can be also used as a subgraph in another graph. For example:
PythonJavaScript

from langgraph_sdk import get_sync_client
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, MessagesState, START
from typing import TypedDict

url = <DEPLOYMENT_URL>
graph_name = "agent"
remote_graph = RemoteGraph(graph_name, url=url)

# define parent graph
builder = StateGraph(MessagesState)
# add remote graph directly as a node
builder.add_node("child", remote_graph)
builder.add_edge(START, "child")
graph = builder.compile()

# invoke the parent graph
result = graph.invoke({
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "what's the weather in sf"}]
})
print(result)

# stream outputs from both the parent graph and subgraph
for chunk in graph.stream({
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "what's the weather in sf"}]
}, subgraphs=True):
    print(chunk)

import { MessagesAnnotation, StateGraph, START } from "@langchain/langgraph";
import { RemoteGraph } from "@langchain/langgraph/remote";

const url = `<DEPLOYMENT_URL>`;
const graphName = "agent";
const remoteGraph = new RemoteGraph({ graphId: graphName, url });

// define parent graph and add remote graph directly as a node
const graph = new StateGraph(MessagesAnnotation)
  .addNode("child", remoteGraph)
  .addEdge(START, "child")
  .compile()

// invoke the parent graph
const result = await graph.invoke({
  messages: [{ role: "user", content: "what's the weather in sf" }]
});
console.log(result);

// stream outputs from both the parent graph and subgraph
for await (const chunk of await graph.stream({
  messages: [{ role: "user", content: "what's the weather in la" }]
}, { subgraphs: true })) {
  console.log(chunk);
}

How to return state before hitting recursion limit¶

Prerequisites

        This guide assumes familiarity with the following:
        

                    Graphs
                

                    Recursion Limit
                

                    Nodes
                

Setting the graph recursion limit can help you control how long your graph will stay running, but if the recursion limit is hit your graph returns an error - which may not be ideal for all use cases. Instead you may wish to return the value of the state just before the recursion limit is hit. This how-to will show you how to do this.
Setup¶
First, let's installed the required packages:
%%capture --no-stderr
%pip install -U langgraph

        Sign up for LangSmith to quickly spot issues and improve the performance of your LangGraph projects. LangSmith lets you use trace data to debug, test, and monitor your LLM apps built with LangGraph — read more about how to get started here. 
    

Without returning state¶
We are going to define a dummy graph in this example that will always hit the recursion limit. First, we will implement it without returning the state and show that it hits the recursion limit. This graph is based on the ReAct architecture, but instead of actually making decisions and taking actions it just loops forever.
from typing_extensions import TypedDict
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph
from langgraph.graph import START, END

class State(TypedDict):
    value: str
    action_result: str

def router(state: State):
    if state["value"] == "end":
        return END
    else:
        return "action"

def decision_node(state):
    return {"value": "keep going!"}

def action_node(state: State):
    # Do your action here ...
    return {"action_result": "what a great result!"}

workflow = StateGraph(State)
workflow.add_node("decision", decision_node)
workflow.add_node("action", action_node)
workflow.add_edge(START, "decision")
workflow.add_conditional_edges("decision", router, ["action", END])
workflow.add_edge("action", "decision")
app = workflow.compile()

API Reference: StateGraph | START | END
from IPython.display import Image, display

display(Image(app.get_graph().draw_mermaid_png()))

Let's verify that our graph will always hit the recursion limit:
from langgraph.errors import GraphRecursionError

try:
    app.invoke({"value": "hi!"})
except GraphRecursionError:
    print("Recursion Error")

Recursion Error

With returning state¶
To avoid hitting the recursion limit, we can introduce a new key to our state called remaining_steps. It will keep track of number of steps until reaching the recursion limit. We can then check the value of remaining_steps to determine whether we should terminate the graph execution and return the state to the user without causing the RecursionError.
To do so, we will use a special RemainingSteps annotation. Under the hood, it creates a special ManagedValue channel -- a state channel that will exist for the duration of our graph run and no longer.
Since our action node is going to always induce at least 2 extra steps to our graph (since the action node ALWAYS calls the decision node afterwards), we will use this channel to check if we are within 2 steps of the limit.
Now, when we run our graph we should receive no errors and instead get the last value of the state before the recursion limit was hit.
from typing_extensions import TypedDict
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph
from typing import Annotated

from langgraph.managed.is_last_step import RemainingSteps

class State(TypedDict):
    value: str
    action_result: str
    remaining_steps: RemainingSteps

def router(state: State):
    # Force the agent to end
    if state["remaining_steps"] <= 2:
        return END
    if state["value"] == "end":
        return END
    else:
        return "action"

def decision_node(state):
    return {"value": "keep going!"}

def action_node(state: State):
    # Do your action here ...
    return {"action_result": "what a great result!"}

workflow = StateGraph(State)
workflow.add_node("decision", decision_node)
workflow.add_node("action", action_node)
workflow.add_edge(START, "decision")
workflow.add_conditional_edges("decision", router, ["action", END])
workflow.add_edge("action", "decision")
app = workflow.compile()

API Reference: StateGraph
app.invoke({"value": "hi!"})

{'value': 'keep going!', 'action_result': 'what a great result!'}

Perfect! Our code ran with no error, just as we expected!

CONTENT:
How to add runtime configuration to your graph¶
Sometimes you want to be able to configure your agent when calling it. 
Examples of this include configuring which LLM to use.
Below we walk through an example of doing so.

Prerequisites

        This guide assumes familiarity with the following:
        

                    LangGraph State
                

                    Chat Models
                

Setup¶
First, let's install the required packages and set our API keys
%%capture --no-stderr
%pip install -U langgraph langchain_anthropic

import getpass
import os

def _set_env(var: str):
    if not os.environ.get(var):
        os.environ[var] = getpass.getpass(f"{var}: ")

_set_env("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY")

        Sign up for LangSmith to quickly spot issues and improve the performance of your LangGraph projects. LangSmith lets you use trace data to debug, test, and monitor your LLM apps built with LangGraph — read more about how to get started here. 
    

Define graph¶
First, let's create a very simple graph
import operator
from typing import Annotated, Sequence
from typing_extensions import TypedDict

from langchain_anthropic import ChatAnthropic
from langchain_core.messages import BaseMessage, HumanMessage

from langgraph.graph import END, StateGraph, START

model = ChatAnthropic(model_name="claude-2.1")

class AgentState(TypedDict):
    messages: Annotated[Sequence[BaseMessage], operator.add]

def _call_model(state):
    state["messages"]
    response = model.invoke(state["messages"])
    return {"messages": [response]}

# Define a new graph
builder = StateGraph(AgentState)
builder.add_node("model", _call_model)
builder.add_edge(START, "model")
builder.add_edge("model", END)

graph = builder.compile()

API Reference: ChatAnthropic | BaseMessage | HumanMessage | END | StateGraph | START
Configure the graph¶
Great! Now let's suppose that we want to extend this example so the user is able to choose from multiple llms.
We can easily do that by passing in a config. Any configuration information needs to be passed inside configurable key as shown below.
This config is meant to contain things are not part of the input (and therefore that we don't want to track as part of the state).
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from typing import Optional
from langchain_core.runnables.config import RunnableConfig

openai_model = ChatOpenAI()

models = {
    "anthropic": model,
    "openai": openai_model,
}

def _call_model(state: AgentState, config: RunnableConfig):
    # Access the config through the configurable key
    model_name = config["configurable"].get("model", "anthropic")
    model = models[model_name]
    response = model.invoke(state["messages"])
    return {"messages": [response]}

# Define a new graph
builder = StateGraph(AgentState)
builder.add_node("model", _call_model)
builder.add_edge(START, "model")
builder.add_edge("model", END)

graph = builder.compile()

API Reference: ChatOpenAI | RunnableConfig
If we call it with no configuration, it will use the default as we defined it (Anthropic).
graph.invoke({"messages": [HumanMessage(content="hi")]})

{'messages': [HumanMessage(content='hi', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}),
  AIMessage(content='Hello!', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={'id': 'msg_01WFXkfgK8AvSckLvYYrHshi', 'model': 'claude-2.1', 'stop_reason': 'end_turn', 'stop_sequence': None, 'usage': {'input_tokens': 10, 'output_tokens': 6}}, id='run-ece54b16-f8fc-4201-8405-b97122edf8d8-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 10, 'output_tokens': 6, 'total_tokens': 16})]}

We can also call it with a config to get it to use a different model.
config = {"configurable": {"model": "openai"}}
graph.invoke({"messages": [HumanMessage(content="hi")]}, config=config)

{'messages': [HumanMessage(content='hi', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}),
  AIMessage(content='Hello! How can I assist you today?', additional_kwargs={'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 9, 'prompt_tokens': 8, 'total_tokens': 17, 'completion_tokens_details': {'reasoning_tokens': 0}}, 'model_name': 'gpt-3.5-turbo-0125', 'system_fingerprint': None, 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, id='run-f8331964-d811-4b44-afb8-56c30ade7c15-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 8, 'output_tokens': 9, 'total_tokens': 17})]}

We can also adapt our graph to take in more configuration! Like a system message for example.
from langchain_core.messages import SystemMessage

# We can define a config schema to specify the configuration options for the graph
# A config schema is useful for indicating which fields are available in the configurable dict inside the config
class ConfigSchema(TypedDict):
    model: Optional[str]
    system_message: Optional[str]

def _call_model(state: AgentState, config: RunnableConfig):
    # Access the config through the configurable key
    model_name = config["configurable"].get("model", "anthropic")
    model = models[model_name]
    messages = state["messages"]
    if "system_message" in config["configurable"]:
        messages = [
            SystemMessage(content=config["configurable"]["system_message"])
        ] + messages
    response = model.invoke(messages)
    return {"messages": [response]}

# Define a new graph - note that we pass in the configuration schema here, but it is not necessary
workflow = StateGraph(AgentState, ConfigSchema)
workflow.add_node("model", _call_model)
workflow.add_edge(START, "model")
workflow.add_edge("model", END)

graph = workflow.compile()

API Reference: SystemMessage
graph.invoke({"messages": [HumanMessage(content="hi")]})

{'messages': [HumanMessage(content='hi', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}),
  AIMessage(content='Hello!', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={'id': 'msg_01VgCANVHr14PsHJSXyKkLVh', 'model': 'claude-2.1', 'stop_reason': 'end_turn', 'stop_sequence': None, 'usage': {'input_tokens': 10, 'output_tokens': 6}}, id='run-f8c5f18c-be58-4e44-9a4e-d43692d7eed1-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 10, 'output_tokens': 6, 'total_tokens': 16})]}

config = {"configurable": {"system_message": "respond in italian"}}
graph.invoke({"messages": [HumanMessage(content="hi")]}, config=config)

{'messages': [HumanMessage(content='hi', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}),
  AIMessage(content='Ciao!', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={'id': 'msg_011YuCYQk1Rzc8PEhVCpQGr6', 'model': 'claude-2.1', 'stop_reason': 'end_turn', 'stop_sequence': None, 'usage': {'input_tokens': 14, 'output_tokens': 7}}, id='run-a583341e-5868-4e8c-a536-881338f21252-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 14, 'output_tokens': 7, 'total_tokens': 21})]}

How to add node retry policies¶

Prerequisites

        This guide assumes familiarity with the following:
        

                    LangGraph Glossary
                

There are many use cases where you may wish for your node to have a custom retry policy, for example if you are calling an API, querying a database, or calling an LLM, etc. 
Setup¶
First, let's install the required packages and set our API keys
%%capture --no-stderr
%pip install -U langgraph langchain_anthropic langchain_community

import getpass
import os

def _set_env(var: str):
    if not os.environ.get(var):
        os.environ[var] = getpass.getpass(f"{var}: ")

_set_env("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY")

        Sign up for LangSmith to quickly spot issues and improve the performance of your LangGraph projects. LangSmith lets you use trace data to debug, test, and monitor your LLM apps built with LangGraph — read more about how to get started here. 
    

In order to configure the retry policy, you have to pass the retry parameter to the add_node. The retry parameter takes in a RetryPolicy named tuple object. Below we instantiate a RetryPolicy object with the default parameters:
from langgraph.pregel import RetryPolicy

RetryPolicy()

RetryPolicy(initial_interval=0.5, backoff_factor=2.0, max_interval=128.0, max_attempts=3, jitter=True, retry_on=<function default_retry_on at 0x78b964b89940>)

By default, the retry_on parameter uses the default_retry_on function, which retries on any exception except for the following:

ValueError
TypeError
ArithmeticError
ImportError
LookupError
NameError
SyntaxError
RuntimeError
ReferenceError
StopIteration
StopAsyncIteration
OSError

In addition, for exceptions from popular http request libraries such as requests and httpx it only retries on 5xx status codes.
Passing a retry policy to a node¶
Lastly, we can pass RetryPolicy objects when we call the add_node function. In the example below we pass two different retry policies to each of our nodes:
import operator
import sqlite3
from typing import Annotated, Sequence
from typing_extensions import TypedDict

from langchain_anthropic import ChatAnthropic
from langchain_core.messages import BaseMessage

from langgraph.graph import END, StateGraph, START
from langchain_community.utilities import SQLDatabase
from langchain_core.messages import AIMessage

db = SQLDatabase.from_uri("sqlite:///:memory:")

model = ChatAnthropic(model_name="claude-2.1")

class AgentState(TypedDict):
    messages: Annotated[Sequence[BaseMessage], operator.add]

def query_database(state):
    query_result = db.run("SELECT * FROM Artist LIMIT 10;")
    return {"messages": [AIMessage(content=query_result)]}

def call_model(state):
    response = model.invoke(state["messages"])
    return {"messages": [response]}

# Define a new graph
builder = StateGraph(AgentState)
builder.add_node(
    "query_database",
    query_database,
    retry=RetryPolicy(retry_on=sqlite3.OperationalError),
)
builder.add_node("model", call_model, retry=RetryPolicy(max_attempts=5))
builder.add_edge(START, "model")
builder.add_edge("model", "query_database")
builder.add_edge("query_database", END)

graph = builder.compile()

How to create map-reduce branches for parallel execution¶

Prerequisites

        This guide assumes familiarity with the following:
        

                    LangGraph Glossary
                

                    Send API
                

                    Chat Models
                

                    Structured Output
                

Map-reduce operations are essential for efficient task decomposition and parallel processing. This approach involves breaking a task into smaller sub-tasks, processing each sub-task in parallel, and aggregating the results across all of the completed sub-tasks. 
Consider this example: given a general topic from the user, generate a list of related subjects, generate a joke for each subject, and select the best joke from the resulting list. In this design pattern, a first node may generate a list of objects (e.g., related subjects) and we want to apply some other node (e.g., generate a joke) to all those objects (e.g., subjects). However, two main challenges arise.
(1) the number of objects (e.g., subjects) may be unknown ahead of time (meaning the number of edges may not be known) when we lay out the graph and (2) the input State to the downstream Node should be different (one for each generated object).
LangGraph addresses these challenges through its Send API. By utilizing conditional edges, Send can distribute different states (e.g., subjects) to multiple instances of a node (e.g., joke generation). Importantly, the sent state can differ from the core graph's state, allowing for flexible and dynamic workflow management. 

Setup¶
First, let's install the required packages and set our API keys

        This notebook uses Pydantic v2 BaseModel, which requires langchain-core >= 0.3. Using langchain-core < 0.3 will result in errors due to mixing of Pydantic v1 and v2 BaseModels.

CONTENT:
How to combine control flow and state updates with Command¶

Prerequisites
This guide assumes familiarity with the following:

State
Nodes
Edges
Command

It can be useful to combine control flow (edges) and state updates (nodes). For example, you might want to BOTH perform state updates AND decide which node to go to next in the SAME node. LangGraph provides a way to do so by returning a Command object from node functions:
def my_node(state: State) -> Command[Literal["my_other_node"]]:
    return Command(
        # state update
        update={"foo": "bar"},
        # control flow
        goto="my_other_node"
    )

If you are using subgraphs, you might want to navigate from a node within a subgraph to a different subgraph (i.e. a different node in the parent graph). To do so, you can specify graph=Command.PARENT in Command:
def my_node(state: State) -> Command[Literal["my_other_node"]]:
    return Command(
        update={"foo": "bar"},
        goto="other_subgraph",  # where `other_subgraph` is a node in the parent graph
        graph=Command.PARENT
    )

State updates with Command.PARENT
When you send updates from a subgraph node to a parent graph node for a key that's shared by both parent and subgraph state schemas, you must define a reducer for the key you're updating in the parent graph state. See this example below.

This guide shows how you can do use Command to add dynamic control flow in your LangGraph app.
Setup¶
First, let's install the required packages
%%capture --no-stderr
%pip install -U langgraph

Set up LangSmith for LangGraph development

        Sign up for LangSmith to quickly spot issues and improve the performance of your LangGraph projects. LangSmith lets you use trace data to debug, test, and monitor your LLM apps built with LangGraph — read more about how to get started here. 
    

Let's create a simple graph with 3 nodes: A, B and C. We will first execute node A, and then decide whether to go to Node B or Node C next based on the output of node A.
Basic usage¶
import random
from typing_extensions import TypedDict, Literal

from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START
from langgraph.types import Command

# Define graph state
class State(TypedDict):
    foo: str

# Define the nodes

def node_a(state: State) -> Command[Literal["node_b", "node_c"]]:
    print("Called A")
    value = random.choice(["a", "b"])
    # this is a replacement for a conditional edge function
    if value == "a":
        goto = "node_b"
    else:
        goto = "node_c"

    # note how Command allows you to BOTH update the graph state AND route to the next node
    return Command(
        # this is the state update
        update={"foo": value},
        # this is a replacement for an edge
        goto=goto,
    )

def node_b(state: State):
    print("Called B")
    return {"foo": state["foo"] + "b"}

def node_c(state: State):
    print("Called C")
    return {"foo": state["foo"] + "c"}

API Reference: StateGraph | START | Command
We can now create the StateGraph with the above nodes. Notice that the graph doesn't have conditional edges for routing! This is because control flow is defined with Command inside node_a.
builder = StateGraph(State)
builder.add_edge(START, "node_a")
builder.add_node(node_a)
builder.add_node(node_b)
builder.add_node(node_c)
# NOTE: there are no edges between nodes A, B and C!

graph = builder.compile()

Important
You might have noticed that we used Command as a return type annotation, e.g. Command[Literal["node_b", "node_c"]]. This is necessary for the graph rendering and tells LangGraph that node_a can navigate to node_b and node_c.

from IPython.display import display, Image

display(Image(graph.get_graph().draw_mermaid_png()))

If we run the graph multiple times, we'd see it take different paths (A -> B or A -> C) based on the random choice in node A.
graph.invoke({"foo": ""})

Called A
Called C

{'foo': 'bc'}

Navigating to a node in a parent graph¶
Now let's demonstrate how you can navigate from inside a subgraph to a different node in a parent graph. We'll do so by changing node_a in the above example into a single-node graph that we'll add as a subgraph to our parent graph.

State updates with Command.PARENT
When you send updates from a subgraph node to a parent graph node for a key that's shared by both parent and subgraph state schemas, you must define a reducer for the key you're updating in the parent graph state.

import operator
from typing_extensions import Annotated

class State(TypedDict):
    # NOTE: we define a reducer here
    foo: Annotated[str, operator.add]

def node_a(state: State):
    print("Called A")
    value = random.choice(["a", "b"])
    # this is a replacement for a conditional edge function
    if value == "a":
        goto = "node_b"
    else:
        goto = "node_c"

    # note how Command allows you to BOTH update the graph state AND route to the next node
    return Command(
        update={"foo": value},
        goto=goto,
        # this tells LangGraph to navigate to node_b or node_c in the parent graph
        # NOTE: this will navigate to the closest parent graph relative to the subgraph
        graph=Command.PARENT,
    )

subgraph = StateGraph(State).add_node(node_a).add_edge(START, "node_a").compile()

def node_b(state: State):
    print("Called B")
    # NOTE: since we've defined a reducer, we don't need to manually append
    # new characters to existing 'foo' value. instead, reducer will append these
    # automatically (via operator.add)
    return {"foo": "b"}

def node_c(state: State):
    print("Called C")
    return {"foo": "c"}

builder = StateGraph(State)
builder.add_edge(START, "subgraph")
builder.add_node("subgraph", subgraph)
builder.add_node(node_b)
builder.add_node(node_c)

graph = builder.compile()

graph.invoke({"foo": ""})

Called A
Called C

{'foo': 'bc'}

How to create and control loops¶

Prerequisites

        This guide assumes familiarity with the following:
        

                    Graphs
                

                    Recursion Limit
                

                    Nodes
                

When creating a graph with a loop, we require a mechanism for terminating execution. This is most commonly done by adding a conditional edge that routes to the END node once we reach some termination condition.
You can also set the graph recursion limit when invoking or streaming the graph. The recursion limit sets the number of supersteps that the graph is allowed to execute before it raises an error. Read more about the concept of recursion limits here. 
Let's consider a simple graph with a loop to better understand how these mechanisms work.

Tip
To return the last value of your state instead of receiving a recursion limit error, read this how-to.

Summary¶
When creating a loop, you can include a conditional edge that specifies a termination condition:
builder = StateGraph(State)
builder.add_node(a)
builder.add_node(b)

def route(state: State) -> Literal["b", END]:
    if termination_condition(state):
        return END
    else:
        return "a"

builder.add_edge(START, "a")
builder.add_conditional_edges("a", route)
builder.add_edge("b", "a")
graph = builder.compile()

To control the recursion limit, specify "recursion_limit" in the config. This will raise a GraphRecursionError, which you can catch and handle:
from langgraph.errors import GraphRecursionError

try:
    graph.invoke(inputs, {"recursion_limit": 3})
except GraphRecursionError:
    print("Recursion Error")

Setup¶
First, let's install the required packages
%%capture --no-stderr
%pip install -U langgraph

Set up LangSmith for LangGraph development

        Sign up for LangSmith to quickly spot issues and improve the performance of your LangGraph projects. LangSmith lets you use trace data to debug, test, and monitor your LLM apps built with LangGraph — read more about how to get started here. 
    

Define the graph¶
Let's define a graph with a simple loop. Note that we use a conditional edge to implement a termination condition.
import operator
from typing import Annotated, Literal

from typing_extensions import TypedDict

from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END

class State(TypedDict):
    # The operator.add reducer fn makes this append-only
    aggregate: Annotated[list, operator.add]

def a(state: State):
    print(f'Node A sees {state["aggregate"]}')
    return {"aggregate": ["A"]}

def b(state: State):
    print(f'Node B sees {state["aggregate"]}')
    return {"aggregate": ["B"]}

# Define nodes
builder = StateGraph(State)
builder.add_node(a)
builder.add_node(b)

# Define edges
def route(state: State) -> Literal["b", END]:
    if len(state["aggregate"]) < 7:
        return "b"
    else:
        return END

builder.add_edge(START, "a")
builder.add_conditional_edges("a", route)
builder.add_edge("b", "a")
graph = builder.compile()

API Reference: StateGraph | START | END
from IPython.display import Image, display

display(Image(graph.get_graph().draw_mermaid_png()))

This architecture is similar to a ReAct agent in which node "a" is a tool-calling model, and node "b" represents the tools.
In our route conditional edge, we specify that we should end after the "aggregate" list in the state passes a threshold length.
Invoking the graph, we see that we alternate between nodes "a" and "b" before terminating once we reach the termination condition.
graph.invoke({"aggregate": []})

Node A sees []
Node B sees ['A']
Node A sees ['A', 'B']
Node B sees ['A', 'B', 'A']
Node A sees ['A', 'B', 'A', 'B']
Node B sees ['A', 'B', 'A', 'B', 'A']
Node A sees ['A', 'B', 'A', 'B', 'A', 'B']

{'aggregate': ['A', 'B', 'A', 'B', 'A', 'B', 'A']}

Impose a recursion limit¶
In some applications, we may not have a guarantee that we will reach a given termination condition. In these cases, we can set the graph's recursion limit. This will raise a GraphRecursionError after a given number of supersteps. We can then catch and handle this exception:
from langgraph.errors import GraphRecursionError

try:
    graph.invoke({"aggregate": []}, {"recursion_limit": 4})
except GraphRecursionError:
    print("Recursion Error")

Node A sees []
Node B sees ['A']
Node A sees ['A', 'B']
Node B sees ['A', 'B', 'A']
Recursion Error

Note that this time we terminate after the fourth step.
Loops with branches¶
To better understand how the recursion limit works, let's consider a more complex example. Below we implement a loop, but one step fans out into two nodes:
import operator
from typing import Annotated, Literal

from typing_extensions import TypedDict

from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END

class State(TypedDict):
    aggregate: Annotated[list, operator.add]

def a(state: State):
    print(f'Node A sees {state["aggregate"]}')
    return {"aggregate": ["A"]}

def b(state: State):
    print(f'Node B sees {state["aggregate"]}')
    return {"aggregate": ["B"]}

def c(state: State):
    print(f'Node C sees {state["aggregate"]}')
    return {"aggregate": ["C"]}

def d(state: State):
    print(f'Node D sees {state["aggregate"]}')
    return {"aggregate": ["D"]}

# Define nodes
builder = StateGraph(State)
builder.add_node(a)
builder.add_node(b)
builder.add_node(c)
builder.add_node(d)

# Define edges
def route(state: State) -> Literal["b", END]:
    if len(state["aggregate"]) < 7:
        return "b"
    else:
        return END

builder.add_edge(START, "a")
builder.add_conditional_edges("a", route)
builder.add_edge("b", "c")
builder.add_edge("b", "d")
builder.add_edge(["c", "d"], "a")
graph = builder.compile()

API Reference: StateGraph | START | END
from IPython.display import Image, display

display(Image(graph.get_graph().draw_mermaid_png()))

This graph looks complex, but can be conceptualized as loop of supersteps:

Node A
Node B
Nodes C and D
Node A
...

We have a loop of four supersteps, where nodes C and D are executed concurrently.
Invoking the graph as before, we see that we complete two full "laps" before hitting the termination condition:
result = graph.invoke({"aggregate": []})

Node A sees []
Node B sees ['A']
Node D sees ['A', 'B']
Node C sees ['A', 'B']
Node A sees ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D']
Node B sees ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'A']
Node D sees ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'A', 'B']
Node C sees ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'A', 'B']
Node A sees ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D']

However, if we set the recursion limit to four, we only complete one lap because each lap is four supersteps:
from langgraph.errors import GraphRecursionError

try:
    result = graph.invoke({"aggregate": []}, {"recursion_limit": 4})
except GraphRecursionError:
    print("Recursion Error")

Node A sees []
Node B sees ['A']
Node C sees ['A', 'B']
Node D sees ['A', 'B']
Node A sees ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D']
Recursion Error

PNG¶
If preferred, we could render the Graph into a  .png. Here we could use three options:

Using Mermaid.ink API (does not require additional packages)
Using Mermaid + Pyppeteer (requires pip install pyppeteer)
Using graphviz (which requires pip install graphviz)

Using Mermaid.Ink¶
By default, draw_mermaid_png() uses Mermaid.Ink's API to generate the diagram.
from IPython.display import Image, display
from langchain_core.runnables.graph import CurveStyle, MermaidDrawMethod, NodeStyles

display(
    Image(
        app.get_graph().draw_mermaid_png(
            draw_method=MermaidDrawMethod.API,
        )
    )
)

API Reference: CurveStyle | MermaidDrawMethod | NodeStyles

Using Mermaid + Pyppeteer¶
%%capture --no-stderr
%pip install --quiet pyppeteer
%pip install --quiet nest_asyncio

import nest_asyncio

nest_asyncio.apply()  # Required for Jupyter Notebook to run async functions

display(
    Image(
        app.get_graph().draw_mermaid_png(

How to update graph state from nodes¶
This guide demonstrates how to define and update state in LangGraph. We will demonstrate:

How to use state to define a graph's schema
How to use reducers to control how state updates are processed.

We will use messages in our examples. This represents a versatile formulation of state for many LLM applications. See our concepts page for more detail.
Setup¶
First, let's install langgraph:
%%capture --no-stderr
%pip install -U langgraph

Set up LangSmith for better debugging

         Sign up for LangSmith to quickly spot issues and improve the performance of your LangGraph projects. LangSmith lets you use trace data to debug, test, and monitor your LLM aps built with LangGraph — read more about how to get started in the docs. 
     

Example graph¶
Define state¶
State in LangGraph can be a TypedDict, Pydantic model, or dataclass. Below we will use TypedDict. See this guide for detail on using Pydantic.
By default, graphs will have the same input and output schema, and the state determines that schema. See this guide for how to define distinct input and output schemas.
Let's consider a simple example:
from langchain_core.messages import AnyMessage
from typing_extensions import TypedDict

class State(TypedDict):
    messages: list[AnyMessage]
    extra_field: int

API Reference: AnyMessage
This state tracks a list of message objects, as well as an extra integer field.
Define graph structure¶
Let's build an example graph with a single node. Our node is just a Python function that reads our graph's state and makes updates to it. The first argument to this function will always be the state:
from langchain_core.messages import AIMessage

def node(state: State):
    messages = state["messages"]
    new_message = AIMessage("Hello!")

    return {"messages": messages + [new_message], "extra_field": 10}

API Reference: AIMessage
This node simply appends a message to our message list, and populates an extra field.

Important
Nodes should return updates to the state directly, instead of mutating the state.

Let's next define a simple graph containing this node. We use StateGraph to define a graph that operates on this state. We then use add_node populate our graph.
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph

graph_builder = StateGraph(State)
graph_builder.add_node(node)
graph_builder.set_entry_point("node")
graph = graph_builder.compile()

API Reference: StateGraph
LangGraph provides built-in utilities for visualizing your graph. Let's inspect our graph. See this guide for detail on visualization.
from IPython.display import Image, display

display(Image(graph.get_graph().draw_mermaid_png()))

In this case, our graph just executes a single node.
Use graph¶
Let's proceed with a simple invocation:
from langchain_core.messages import HumanMessage

result = graph.invoke({"messages": [HumanMessage("Hi")]})
result

API Reference: HumanMessage
{'messages': [HumanMessage(content='Hi', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}),
  AIMessage(content='Hello!', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={})],
 'extra_field': 10}

Note that:

We kicked off invocation by updating a single key of the state.
We receive the entire state in the invocation result.

For convenience, we frequently inspect the content of message objects via pretty-print:
for message in result["messages"]:
    message.pretty_print()

================================[1m Human Message [0m=================================

Hi
==================================[1m Ai Message [0m==================================

Hello!

Process state updates with reducers¶
Each key in the state can have its own independent reducer function, which controls how updates from nodes are applied. If no reducer function is explicitly specified then it is assumed that all updates to the key should override it.
For TypedDict state schemas, we can define reducers by annotating the corresponding field of the state with a reducer function.
In the earlier example, our node updated the "messages" key in the state by appending a message to it. Below, we add a reducer to this key, such that updates are automatically appended:
from typing_extensions import Annotated

def add(left, right):
    """Can also import `add` from the `operator` built-in."""
    return left + right

class State(TypedDict):
    messages: Annotated[list[AnyMessage], add]
    extra_field: int

Now our node can be simplified:
def node(state: State):
    new_message = AIMessage("Hello!")
    return {"messages": [new_message], "extra_field": 10}

from langgraph.graph import START

graph = StateGraph(State).add_node(node).add_edge(START, "node").compile()

result = graph.invoke({"messages": [HumanMessage("Hi")]})

for message in result["messages"]:
    message.pretty_print()

API Reference: START
================================[1m Human Message [0m=================================

Hi
==================================[1m Ai Message [0m==================================

Hello!

MessagesState¶
In practice, there are additional considerations for updating lists of messages:

We may wish to update an existing message in the state.
We may want to accept short-hands for message formats, such as OpenAI format.

LangGraph includes a built-in reducer add_messages that handles these considerations:
from langgraph.graph.message import add_messages

class State(TypedDict):
    messages: Annotated[list[AnyMessage], add_messages]
    extra_field: int

def node(state: State):
    new_message = AIMessage("Hello!")
    return {"messages": [new_message], "extra_field": 10}

graph = StateGraph(State).add_node(node).set_entry_point("node").compile()

API Reference: add_messages
input_message = {"role": "user", "content": "Hi"}

result = graph.invoke({"messages": [input_message]})

for message in result["messages"]:
    message.pretty_print()

================================[1m Human Message [0m=================================

Hi
==================================[1m Ai Message [0m==================================

Hello!

This is a versatile representation of state for applications involving chat models. LangGraph includes a pre-built MessagesState for convenience, so that we can have:
from langgraph.graph import MessagesState

class State(MessagesState):
    extra_field: int

How to create branches for parallel node execution¶

Prerequisites

        This guide assumes familiarity with the following:
        

                    Node
                

                    Edge
                

                    Reducer
                

Parallel execution of nodes is essential to speed up overall graph operation. LangGraph offers native support for parallel execution of nodes, which can significantly enhance the performance of graph-based workflows. This parallelization is achieved through fan-out and fan-in mechanisms, utilizing both standard edges and conditional_edges. Below are some examples showing how to add create branching dataflows that work for you. 

Setup¶
First, let's install the required packages
%%capture --no-stderr
%pip install -U langgraph

Set up LangSmith for LangGraph development

        Sign up for LangSmith to quickly spot issues and improve the performance of your LangGraph projects. LangSmith lets you use trace data to debug, test, and monitor your LLM apps built with LangGraph — read more about how to get started here. 
    

How to run graph nodes in parallel¶
In this example, we fan out from Node A to B and C and then fan in to D. With our state, we specify the reducer add operation. This will combine or accumulate values for the specific key in the State, rather than simply overwriting the existing value. For lists, this means concatenating the new list with the existing list. See this guide for more detail on updating state with reducers.
import operator
from typing import Annotated, Any

from typing_extensions import TypedDict

from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END

class State(TypedDict):
    # The operator.add reducer fn makes this append-only
    aggregate: Annotated[list, operator.add]

def a(state: State):
    print(f'Adding "A" to {state["aggregate"]}')
    return {"aggregate": ["A"]}

def b(state: State):
    print(f'Adding "B" to {state["aggregate"]}')
    return {"aggregate": ["B"]}

def c(state: State):
    print(f'Adding "C" to {state["aggregate"]}')
    return {"aggregate": ["C"]}

def d(state: State):
    print(f'Adding "D" to {state["aggregate"]}')
    return {"aggregate": ["D"]}

builder = StateGraph(State)
builder.add_node(a)
builder.add_node(b)
builder.add_node(c)
builder.add_node(d)
builder.add_edge(START, "a")
builder.add_edge("a", "b")
builder.add_edge("a", "c")
builder.add_edge("b", "d")
builder.add_edge("c", "d")
builder.add_edge("d", END)
graph = builder.compile()

API Reference: StateGraph | START | END
from IPython.display import Image, display

display(Image(graph.get_graph().draw_mermaid_png()))

With the reducer, you can see that the values added in each node are accumulated.
graph.invoke({"aggregate": []}, {"configurable": {"thread_id": "foo"}})

Adding "A" to []
Adding "B" to ['A']
Adding "C" to ['A']
Adding "D" to ['A', 'B', 'C']

{'aggregate': ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D']}

Note
In the above example, nodes "b" and "c" are executed concurrently in the same superstep. Because they are in the same step, node "d" executes after both "b" and "c" are finished.
Importantly, updates from a parallel superstep may not be ordered consistently. If you need a consistent, predetermined ordering of updates from a parallel superstep, you should write the outputs to a separate field in the state together with a value with which to order them.

 Exception handling?
LangGraph executes nodes within "supersteps", meaning that while parallel branches are executed in parallel, the entire superstep is transactional. If any of these branches raises an exception, none of the updates are applied to the state (the entire superstep errors).
Importantly, when using a checkpointer, results from successful nodes within a superstep are saved, and don't repeat when resumed.
 If you have error-prone (perhaps want to handle flakey API calls), LangGraph provides two ways to address this:

You can write regular python code within your node to catch and handle exceptions.
You can set a retry_policy to direct the graph to retry nodes that raise certain types of exceptions. Only failing branches are retried, so you needn't worry about performing redundant work.

Together, these let you perform parallel execution and fully control exception handling.

Parallel node fan-out and fan-in with extra steps¶
The above example showed how to fan-out and fan-in when each path was only one step. But what if one path had more than one step? Let's add a node b_2 in the "b" branch:
def b_2(state: State):
    print(f'Adding "B_2" to {state["aggregate"]}')
    return {"aggregate": ["B_2"]}

builder = StateGraph(State)
builder.add_node(a)
builder.add_node(b)
builder.add_node(b_2)
builder.add_node(c)
builder.add_node(d)
builder.add_edge(START, "a")
builder.add_edge("a", "b")
builder.add_edge("a", "c")
builder.add_edge("b", "b_2")
builder.add_edge(["b_2", "c"], "d")
builder.add_edge("d", END)
graph = builder.compile()

from IPython.display import Image, display

display(Image(graph.get_graph().draw_mermaid_png()))

graph.invoke({"aggregate": []})

Adding "A" to []
Adding "B" to ['A']
Adding "C" to ['A']
Adding "B_2" to ['A', 'B', 'C']
Adding "D" to ['A', 'B', 'C', 'B_2']

{'aggregate': ['A', 'B', 'C', 'B_2', 'D']}

Note
In the above example, nodes "b" and "c" are executed concurrently in the same superstep. What happens in the next step?
We use add_edge(["b_2", "c"], "d") here to force node "d" to only run when both nodes "b_2" and "c" have finished execution. If we added two separate edges,
node "d" would run twice: after node b2 finishes and once again after node c (in whichever order those nodes finish).

Conditional Branching¶
If your fan-out is not deterministic, you can use add_conditional_edges directly.
import operator
from typing import Annotated, Sequence

from typing_extensions import TypedDict

from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END

class State(TypedDict):
    aggregate: Annotated[list, operator.add]
    # Add a key to the state. We will set this key to determine
    # how we branch.
    which: str

def a(state: State):
    print(f'Adding "A" to {state["aggregate"]}')
    return {"aggregate": ["A"]}

def b(state: State):
    print(f'Adding "B" to {state["aggregate"]}')
    return {"aggregate": ["B"]}

def c(state: State):
    print(f'Adding "C" to {state["aggregate"]}')
    return {"aggregate": ["C"]}

def d(state: State):
    print(f'Adding "D" to {state["aggregate"]}')
    return {"aggregate": ["D"]}

def e(state: State):
    print(f'Adding "E" to {state["aggregate"]}')
    return {"aggregate": ["E"]}

builder = StateGraph(State)
builder.add_node(a)
builder.add_node(b)
builder.add_node(c)
builder.add_node(d)
builder.add_node(e)
builder.add_edge(START, "a")

def route_bc_or_cd(state: State) -> Sequence[str]:
    if state["which"] == "cd":
        return ["c", "d"]
    return ["b", "c"]

intermediates = ["b", "c", "d"]
builder.add_conditional_edges(
    "a",
    route_bc_or_cd,
    intermediates,
)
for node in intermediates:
    builder.add_edge(node, "e")

builder.add_edge("e", END)
graph = builder.compile()

API Reference: StateGraph | START | END
from IPython.display import Image, display

display(Image(graph.get_graph().draw_mermaid_png()))

graph.invoke({"aggregate": [], "which": "bc"})

Adding "A" to []
Adding "B" to ['A']
Adding "C" to ['A']
Adding "E" to ['A', 'B', 'C']

{'aggregate': ['A', 'B', 'C', 'E'], 'which': 'bc'}

graph.invoke({"aggregate": [], "which": "cd"})

Adding "A" to []
Adding "C" to ['A']
Adding "D" to ['A']
Adding "E" to ['A', 'C', 'D']

{'aggregate': ['A', 'C', 'D', 'E'], 'which': 'cd'}

How to create a sequence of steps¶

Prerequisites
This guide assumes familiarity with the following:

How to define and update graph state

This guide demonstrates how to construct a simple sequence of steps. We will demonstrate:

How to build a sequential graph
Built-in short-hand for constructing similar graphs.

Summary¶
To add a sequence of nodes, we use the .add_node and .add_edge methods of our graph:
from langgraph.graph import START, StateGraph

graph_builder = StateGraph(State)

# Add nodes
graph_builder.add_node(step_1)
graph_builder.add_node(step_2)
graph_builder.add_node(step_3)

# Add edges
graph_builder.add_edge(START, "step_1")
graph_builder.add_edge("step_1", "step_2")
graph_builder.add_edge("step_2", "step_3")

API Reference: START | StateGraph
We can also use the built-in shorthand .add_sequence:
graph_builder = StateGraph(State).add_sequence([step_1, step_2, step_3])
graph_builder.add_edge(START, "step_1")

Why split application steps into a sequence with LangGraph?

LangGraph makes it easy to add an underlying persistence layer to your application.
This allows state to be checkpointed in between the execution of nodes, so your LangGraph nodes govern:

How state updates are checkpointed
How interruptions are resumed in human-in-the-loop workflows
How we can "rewind" and branch-off executions using LangGraph's time travel features

They also determine how execution steps are streamed, and how your application is visualized
and debugged using LangGraph Studio.

Setup¶
First, let's install langgraph:
%%capture --no-stderr
%pip install -U langgraph

Set up LangSmith for better debugging

         Sign up for LangSmith to quickly spot issues and improve the performance of your LangGraph projects. LangSmith lets you use trace data to debug, test, and monitor your LLM aps built with LangGraph — read more about how to get started in the docs. 
     

Build the graph¶
Let's demonstrate a simple usage example. We will create a sequence of three steps:

Populate a value in a key of the state
Update the same value
Populate a different value

Define state¶
Let's first define our state. This governs the schema of the graph, and can also specify how to apply updates. See this guide for more detail.
In our case, we will just keep track of two values:
from typing_extensions import TypedDict

class State(TypedDict):
    value_1: str
    value_2: int

Define nodes¶
Our nodes are just Python functions that read our graph's state and make updates to it. The first argument to this function will always be the state:
def step_1(state: State):
    return {"value_1": "a"}

def step_2(state: State):
    current_value_1 = state["value_1"]
    return {"value_1": f"{current_value_1} b"}

def step_3(state: State):
    return {"value_2": 10}

Note
Note that when issuing updates to the state, each node can just specify the value of the key it wishes to update.

By default, this will overwrite the value of the corresponding key. You can also use reducers to control how updates are processed— for example, you can append successive updates to a key instead. See this guide for more detail.
Define graph¶
We use StateGraph to define a graph that operates on this state.
We will then use add_node and add_edge to populate our graph and define its control flow.
from langgraph.graph import START, StateGraph

graph_builder = StateGraph(State)

# Add nodes
graph_builder.add_node(step_1)
graph_builder.add_node(step_2)
graph_builder.add_node(step_3)

# Add edges
graph_builder.add_edge(START, "step_1")
graph_builder.add_edge("step_1", "step_2")
graph_builder.add_edge("step_2", "step_3")

API Reference: START | StateGraph

Specifying custom names
You can specify custom names for nodes using .add_node:
graph_builder.add_node("my_node", step_1)

Note that:

.add_edge takes the names of nodes, which for functions defaults to node.__name__.
We must specify the entry point of the graph. For this we add an edge with the START node.
The graph halts when there are no more nodes to execute.

We next compile our graph. This provides a few basic checks on the structure of the graph (e.g., identifying orphaned nodes). If we were adding persistence to our application via a checkpointer, it would also be passed in here.
graph = graph_builder.compile()

LangGraph provides built-in utilities for visualizing your graph. Let's inspect our sequence. See this guide for detail on visualization.
from IPython.display import Image, display

display(Image(graph.get_graph().draw_mermaid_png()))

Usage¶
Let's proceed with a simple invocation:
graph.invoke({"value_1": "c"})

{'value_1': 'a b', 'value_2': 10}

Note that:

We kicked off invocation by providing a value for a single state key. We must always provide a value for at least one key.
The value we passed in was overwritten by the first node.
The second node updated the value.
The third node populated a different value.

Built-in shorthand¶

Prerequisites
.add_sequence requires langgraph>=0.2.46

LangGraph includes a built-in shorthand .add_sequence for convenience:
graph_builder = StateGraph(State).add_sequence([step_1, step_2, step_3])
graph_builder.add_edge(START, "step_1")

graph = graph_builder.compile()

graph.invoke({"value_1": "c"})

{'value_1': 'a b', 'value_2': 10}

How to add custom lifespan events¶
When deploying agents on the LangGraph platform, you often need to initialize resources like database connections when your server starts up, and ensure they're properly closed when it shuts down. Lifespan events let you hook into your server's startup and shutdown sequence to handle these critical setup and teardown tasks.
This works the same way as adding custom routes - you just need to provide your own Starlette app (including FastAPI, FastHTML and other compatible apps).
Below is an example using FastAPI.

Python only
We currently only support custom lifespan events in Python deployments with langgraph-api>=0.0.26.

Create app¶
Starting from an existing LangGraph Platform application, add the following lifespan code to your webapp.py file. If you are starting from scratch, you can create a new app from a template using the CLI.
langgraph new --template=new-langgraph-project-python my_new_project

Once you have a LangGraph project, add the following app code:
# ./src/agent/webapp.py
from contextlib import asynccontextmanager
from fastapi import FastAPI
from sqlalchemy.ext.asyncio import create_async_engine, AsyncSession
from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker

@asynccontextmanager
async def lifespan(app: FastAPI):
    # for example...
    engine = create_async_engine("postgresql+asyncpg://user:pass@localhost/db")
    # Create reusable session factory
    async_session = sessionmaker(engine, class_=AsyncSession)
    # Store in app state
    app.state.db_session = async_session
    yield
    # Clean up connections
    await engine.dispose()

app = FastAPI(lifespan=lifespan)

# ... can add custom routes if needed.

Configure langgraph.json¶
Add the following to your langgraph.json file. Make sure the path points to the webapp.py file you created above.
{
  "dependencies": ["."],
  "graphs": {
    "agent": "./src/agent/graph.py:graph"
  },
  "env": ".env",
  "http": {
    "app": "./src/agent/webapp.py:app"
  }
  // Other configuration options like auth, store, etc.
}

Start server¶
Test the server out locally:
langgraph dev --no-browser

You should see your startup message printed when the server starts, and your cleanup message when you stop it with Ctrl+C.
Deploying¶
You can deploy your app as-is to the managed langgraph cloud or to your self-hosted platform.
Next steps¶
Now that you've added lifespan events to your deployment, you can use similar techniques to add custom routes or custom middleware to further customize your server's behavior.

When deploying agents on the LangGraph platform, you can add custom middleware to your server to handle cross-cutting concerns like logging request metrics, injecting or checking headers, and enforcing security policies without modifying core server logic. This works the same way as adding custom routes - you just need to provide your own Starlette app (including FastAPI, FastHTML and other compatible apps).
Adding middleware lets you intercept and modify requests and responses globally across your deployment, whether they're hitting your custom endpoints or the built-in LangGraph Platform APIs.
Below is an example using FastAPI.

Python only
We currently only support custom middleware in Python deployments with langgraph-api>=0.0.26.

Create app¶
Starting from an existing LangGraph Platform application, add the following middleware code to your webapp.py file. If you are starting from scratch, you can create a new app from a template using the CLI.
langgraph new --template=new-langgraph-project-python my_new_project

Once you have a LangGraph project, add the following app code:
# ./src/agent/webapp.py
from fastapi import FastAPI, Request
from starlette.middleware.base import BaseHTTPMiddleware

app = FastAPI()

class CustomHeaderMiddleware(BaseHTTPMiddleware):
    async def dispatch(self, request: Request, call_next):
        response = await call_next(request)
        response.headers['X-Custom-Header'] = 'Hello from middleware!'
        return response

# Add the middleware to the app
app.add_middleware(CustomHeaderMiddleware)

Configure langgraph.json¶
Add the following to your langgraph.json file. Make sure the path points to the webapp.py file you created above.
{
  "dependencies": ["."],
  "graphs": {
    "agent": "./src/agent/graph.py:graph"
  },
  "env": ".env",
  "http": {
    "app": "./src/agent/webapp.py:app"
  }
  // Other configuration options like auth, store, etc.
}

Start server¶
Test the server out locally:
langgraph dev --no-browser

Now any request to your server will include the custom header X-Custom-Header in its response.
Deploying¶
You can deploy this app as-is to the managed langgraph cloud or to your self-hosted platform.
Next steps¶
Now that you've added custom middleware to your deployment, you can use similar techniques to add custom routes or define custom lifespan events to further customize your server's behavior.

How to add custom routes¶
When deploying agents on the LangGraph platform, your server automatically exposes routes for creating runs and threads, interacting with the long-term memory store, managing configurable assistants, and other core functionality (see all default API endpoints).
You can add custom routes by providing your own Starlette app (including FastAPI, FastHTML and other compatible apps). You make LangGraph Platform aware of this by providing a path to the app in your langgraph.json configuration file. ("http": {"app": "path/to/app.py:app"}).
Defining a custom app object lets you add any routes you'd like, so you can do anything from adding a /login endpoint to writing an entire full-stack web-app, all deployed in a single LangGraph deployment.
Below is an example using FastAPI.

Python only
We currently only support custom authentication and authorization in Python deployments with langgraph-api>=0.0.26.

Create app¶
Starting from an existing LangGraph Platform application, add the following custom route code to your webapp.py file. If you are starting from scratch, you can create a new app from a template using the CLI.
langgraph new --template=new-langgraph-project-python my_new_project

Once you have a LangGraph project, add the following app code:
# ./src/agent/webapp.py
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/hello")
def read_root():
    return {"Hello": "World"}

Configure langgraph.json¶
Add the following to your langgraph.json file. Make sure the path points to the app.py file you created above.
{
  "dependencies": ["."],
  "graphs": {
    "agent": "./src/agent/graph.py:graph"
  },
  "env": ".env",
  "http": {
    "app": "./src/agent/webapp.py:app"
  }
  // Other configuration options like auth, store, etc.
}

Start server¶
Test the server out locally:
langgraph dev --no-browser

If you navigate to localhost:2024/hello in your browser (2024 is the default development port), you should see the hello endpoint returning {"Hello": "World"}.

Shadowing default endpoints
The routes you create in the app are given priority over the system defaults, meaning you can shadow and redefine the behavior of any default endpoint.

Deploying¶
You can deploy this app as-is to the managed langgraph cloud or to your self-hosted platform.
Next steps¶
Now that you've added a custom route to your deployment, you can use this same technique to further customize how your server behaves, such as defining custom custom middleware and custom lifespan events.

How to use Pydantic model as graph state¶

Prerequisites

        This guide assumes familiarity with the following:
        

                    State
                

                    Nodes
                

                    Pydantic
                : this is a popular Python library for run time validation.
            

A StateGraph accepts a state_schema argument on initialization that specifies the "shape" of the state that the nodes in the graph can access and update.
In our examples, we typically use a python-native TypedDict for state_schema (or in the case of MessageGraph, a list), but state_schema can be any type.
In this how-to guide, we'll see how a Pydantic BaseModel. can be used for state_schema to add run time validation on inputs.

Known Limitations

              This notebook uses Pydantic v2 BaseModel, which requires langchain-core >= 0.3. Using langchain-core < 0.3 will result in errors due to mixing of Pydantic v1 and v2 BaseModels.      
            

                Currently, the `output` of the graph will **NOT** be an instance of a pydantic model.
            

                Run-time validation only occurs on **inputs** into nodes, not on the outputs.
            

                The validation error trace from pydantic does not show which node the error arises in.
            

Setup¶
First we need to install the packages required
%%capture --no-stderr
%pip install --quiet -U langgraph

import getpass
import os

def _set_env(var: str):
    if not os.environ.get(var):
        os.environ[var] = getpass.getpass(f"{var}: ")

_set_env("OPENAI_API_KEY")

Input Validation¶
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END
from typing_extensions import TypedDict

from pydantic import BaseModel

# The overall state of the graph (this is the public state shared across nodes)
class OverallState(BaseModel):
    a: str

def node(state: OverallState):
    return {"a": "goodbye"}

# Build the state graph
builder = StateGraph(OverallState)
builder.add_node(node)  # node_1 is the first node
builder.add_edge(START, "node")  # Start the graph with node_1
builder.add_edge("node", END)  # End the graph after node_1
graph = builder.compile()

# Test the graph with a valid input
graph.invoke({"a": "hello"})

API Reference: StateGraph | START | END
{'a': 'goodbye'}

Invoke the graph with an invalid input
try:
    graph.invoke({"a": 123})  # Should be a string
except Exception as e:
    print("An exception was raised because `a` is an integer rather than a string.")
    print(e)

An exception was raised because `a` is an integer rather than a string.
1 validation error for OverallState
a
  Input should be a valid string [type=string_type, input_value=123, input_type=int]
    For further information visit https://errors.pydantic.dev/2.9/v/string_type

Multiple Nodes¶
Run-time validation will also work in a multi-node graph. In the example below bad_node updates a to an integer. 
Because run-time validation occurs on inputs, the validation error will occur when ok_node is called (not when bad_node returns an update to the state which is inconsistent with the schema).
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END
from typing_extensions import TypedDict

from pydantic import BaseModel

# The overall state of the graph (this is the public state shared across nodes)
class OverallState(BaseModel):
    a: str

def bad_node(state: OverallState):
    return {
        "a": 123  # Invalid
    }

def ok_node(state: OverallState):
    return {"a": "goodbye"}

# Build the state graph
builder = StateGraph(OverallState)
builder.add_node(bad_node)
builder.add_node(ok_node)
builder.add_edge(START, "bad_node")
builder.add_edge("bad_node", "ok_node")
builder.add_edge("ok_node", END)
graph = builder.compile()

# Test the graph with a valid input
try:
    graph.invoke({"a": "hello"})
except Exception as e:
    print("An exception was raised because bad_node sets `a` to an integer.")
    print(e)

API Reference: StateGraph | START | END
An exception was raised because bad_node sets `a` to an integer.
1 validation error for OverallState
a
  Input should be a valid string [type=string_type, input_value=123, input_type=int]

Advanced Pydantic Model Usage¶
This section covers more advanced topics when using Pydantic models with LangGraph.
Serialization Behavior¶
When using Pydantic models as state schemas, it's important to understand how serialization works, especially when:
- Passing Pydantic objects as inputs
- Receiving outputs from the graph
- Working with nested Pydantic models
Let's see these behaviors in action:
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END
from pydantic import BaseModel

class NestedModel(BaseModel):
    value: str

class ComplexState(BaseModel):
    text: str
    count: int
    nested: NestedModel

def process_node(state: ComplexState):
    # Node receives a validated Pydantic object
    print(f"Input state type: {type(state)}")
    print(f"Nested type: {type(state.nested)}")

    # Return a dictionary update
    return {"text": state.text + " processed", "count": state.count + 1}

# Build the graph
builder = StateGraph(ComplexState)
builder.add_node("process", process_node)
builder.add_edge(START, "process")
builder.add_edge("process", END)
graph = builder.compile()

# Create a Pydantic instance for input
input_state = ComplexState(text="hello", count=0, nested=NestedModel(value="test"))
print(f"Input object type: {type(input_state)}")

# Invoke graph with a Pydantic instance
result = graph.invoke(input_state)
print(f"Output type: {type(result)}")
print(f"Output content: {result}")

# Convert back to Pydantic model if needed
output_model = ComplexState(**result)
print(f"Converted back to Pydantic: {type(output_model)}")

API Reference: StateGraph | START | END
Runtime Type Coercion¶
Pydantic performs runtime type coercion for certain data types. This can be helpful but also lead to unexpected behavior if you're not aware of it.
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END
from pydantic import BaseModel

class CoercionExample(BaseModel):
    # Pydantic will coerce string numbers to integers
    number: int
    # Pydantic will parse string booleans to bool
    flag: bool

def inspect_node(state: CoercionExample):
    print(f"number: {state.number} (type: {type(state.number)})")
    print(f"flag: {state.flag} (type: {type(state.flag)})")
    return {}

builder = StateGraph(CoercionExample)
builder.add_node("inspect", inspect_node)
builder.add_edge(START, "inspect")
builder.add_edge("inspect", END)
graph = builder.compile()

# Demonstrate coercion with string inputs that will be converted
result = graph.invoke({"number": "42", "flag": "true"})

# This would fail with a validation error
try:
    graph.invoke({"number": "not-a-number", "flag": "true"})
except Exception as e:
    print(f"\nExpected validation error: {e}")

API Reference: StateGraph | START | END
Working with Message Models¶
When working with LangChain message types in your state schema, there are important considerations for serialization. You should use AnyMessage (rather than BaseMessage) for proper serialization/deserialization when using message objects over the wire:
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END
from pydantic import BaseModel
from langchain_core.messages import HumanMessage, AIMessage, AnyMessage
from typing import List

class ChatState(BaseModel):
    messages: List[AnyMessage]
    context: str

def add_message(state: ChatState):
    return {"messages": state.messages + [AIMessage(content="Hello there!")]}

builder = StateGraph(ChatState)
builder.add_node("add_message", add_message)
builder.add_edge(START, "add_message")
builder.add_edge("add_message", END)
graph = builder.compile()

# Create input with a message
initial_state = ChatState(
    messages=[HumanMessage(content="Hi")], context="Customer support chat"
)

result = graph.invoke(initial_state)
print(f"Output: {result}")

# Convert back to Pydantic model to see message types
output_model = ChatState(**result)
for i, msg in enumerate(output_model.messages):
    print(f"Message {i}: {type(msg).__name__} - {msg.content}")

API Reference: StateGraph | START | END | HumanMessage | AIMessage | AnyMessage

How to define input/output schema for your graph¶

Prerequisites

        This guide assumes familiarity with the following:
        

                    Multiple Schemas
                

                    State Graph
                

By default, StateGraph operates with a single schema, and all nodes are expected to communicate using that schema. However, it's also possible to define distinct input and output schemas for a graph.
When distinct schemas are specified, an internal schema will still be used for communication between nodes. The input schema ensures that the provided input matches the expected structure, while the output schema filters the internal data to return only the relevant information according to the defined output schema.
In this example, we'll see how to define distinct input and output schema.
Setup¶
First, let's install the required packages
%%capture --no-stderr
%pip install -U langgraph

Define and use the graph¶
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END
from typing_extensions import TypedDict

# Define the schema for the input
class InputState(TypedDict):
    question: str

# Define the schema for the output
class OutputState(TypedDict):
    answer: str

# Define the overall schema, combining both input and output
class OverallState(InputState, OutputState):
    pass

# Define the node that processes the input and generates an answer
def answer_node(state: InputState):
    # Example answer and an extra key
    return {"answer": "bye", "question": state["question"]}

# Build the graph with input and output schemas specified
builder = StateGraph(OverallState, input=InputState, output=OutputState)
builder.add_node(answer_node)  # Add the answer node
builder.add_edge(START, "answer_node")  # Define the starting edge
builder.add_edge("answer_node", END)  # Define the ending edge
graph = builder.compile()  # Compile the graph

# Invoke the graph with an input and print the result
print(graph.invoke({"question": "hi"}))

API Reference: StateGraph | START | END
{'answer': 'bye'}

Notice that the output of invoke only includes the output schema.

How to pass private state between nodes¶

Prerequisites

        This guide assumes familiarity with the following:
        

                    Multiple Schemas
                

In some cases, you may want nodes to exchange information that is crucial for intermediate logic but doesn’t need to be part of the main schema of the graph. This private data is not relevant to the overall input/output of the graph and should only be shared between certain nodes.
In this how-to guide, we'll create an example sequential graph consisting of three nodes (node_1, node_2 and node_3), where private data is passed between the first two steps (node_1 and node_2), while the third step (node_3) only has access to the public overall state.

How to run a graph asynchronously¶

Prerequisites

        This guide assumes familiarity with the following:
        

                    async programming
                

                    LangGraph Glossary
                

                    Runnable Interface
                

Using the async programming paradigm can produce significant performance improvements when running IO-bound code concurrently (e.g., making concurrent API requests to a chat model provider).
To convert a sync implementation of the graph to an async implementation, you will need to:

Update nodes use async def instead of def.
Update the code inside to use await appropriately.

Because many LangChain objects implement the Runnable Protocol which has async variants of all the sync methods it's typically fairly quick to upgrade a sync graph to an async graph.

Note

        In this how-to, we will create our agent from scratch to be transparent (but verbose). You can accomplish similar functionality using the create_react_agent(model, tools=tool) (API doc) constructor. This may be more appropriate if you are used to LangChain’s AgentExecutor class.
    

Setup¶
First we need to install the packages required
%%capture --no-stderr
%pip install --quiet -U langgraph langchain_anthropic

Next, we need to set API keys for Anthropic (the LLM we will use).
import getpass
import os

Set up the State¶
The main type of graph in langgraph is the StateGraph.
This graph is parameterized by a State object that it passes around to each node.
Each node then returns operations the graph uses to update that state.
These operations can either SET specific attributes on the state (e.g. overwrite the existing values) or ADD to the existing attribute.
Whether to set or add is denoted by annotating the State object you use to construct the graph.
For this example, the state we will track will just be a list of messages.
We want each node to just add messages to that list.
Therefore, we will use a TypedDict with one key (messages) and annotate it so that the messages attribute is "append-only".
from typing import Annotated

from typing_extensions import TypedDict

from langgraph.graph.message import add_messages

# Add messages essentially does this with more
# robust handling
# def add_messages(left: list, right: list):
#     return left + right

class State(TypedDict):
    messages: Annotated[list, add_messages]

API Reference: add_messages
Set up the tools¶
We will first define the tools we want to use.
For this simple example, we will use create a placeholder search engine.
It is really easy to create your own tools - see documentation here on how to do that.
from langchain_core.tools import tool

@tool
def search(query: str):
    """Call to surf the web."""
    # This is a placeholder, but don't tell the LLM that...
    return ["The answer to your question lies within."]

tools = [search]

API Reference: tool
We can now wrap these tools in a simple ToolNode.
This is  a simple class that takes in a list of messages containing an AIMessages with tool_calls, runs the tools, and returns the output as ToolMessages.
from langgraph.prebuilt import ToolNode

tool_node = ToolNode(tools)

API Reference: ToolNode
Set up the model¶
Now we need to load the chat model we want to use.
This should satisfy two criteria:

It should work with messages, since our state is primarily a list of messages (chat history).
It should work with tool calling, since we are using a prebuilt ToolNode

Note: these model requirements are not requirements for using LangGraph - they are just requirements for this particular example.
from langchain_anthropic import ChatAnthropic

model = ChatAnthropic(model="claude-3-haiku-20240307")

API Reference: ChatAnthropic
After we've done this, we should make sure the model knows that it has these tools available to call.
We can do this by converting the LangChain tools into the format for function calling, and then bind them to the model class.
model = model.bind_tools(tools)

Define the nodes¶
We now need to define a few different nodes in our graph.
In langgraph, a node can be either a function or a runnable.
There are two main nodes we need for this:

The agent: responsible for deciding what (if any) actions to take.
A function to invoke tools: if the agent decides to take an action, this node will then execute that action.

We will also need to define some edges.
Some of these edges may be conditional.
The reason they are conditional is that based on the output of a node, one of several paths may be taken.
The path that is taken is not known until that node is run (the LLM decides).

Conditional Edge: after the agent is called, we should either:
   a. If the agent said to take an action, then the function to invoke tools should be called
   b. If the agent said that it was finished, then it should finish
Normal Edge: after the tools are invoked, it should always go back to the agent to decide what to do next

Let's define the nodes, as well as a function to decide how what conditional edge to take.
MODIFICATION
We define each node as an async function.
from typing import Literal

# Define the function that determines whether to continue or not
def should_continue(state: State) -> Literal["end", "continue"]:
    messages = state["messages"]
    last_message = messages[-1]
    # If there is no tool call, then we finish
    if not last_message.tool_calls:
        return "end"
    # Otherwise if there is, we continue
    else:
        return "continue"

# Define the function that calls the model
async def call_model(state: State):
    messages = state["messages"]
    response = await model.ainvoke(messages)
    # We return a list, because this will get added to the existing list
    return {"messages": [response]}

Define the graph¶
We can now put it all together and define the graph!
from langgraph.graph import END, StateGraph, START

# Define a new graph
workflow = StateGraph(State)

# Define the two nodes we will cycle between
workflow.add_node("agent", call_model)
workflow.add_node("action", tool_node)

# Set the entrypoint as `agent`
# This means that this node is the first one called
workflow.add_edge(START, "agent")

# We now add a conditional edge
workflow.add_conditional_edges(
    # First, we define the start node. We use `agent`.
    # This means these are the edges taken after the `agent` node is called.
    "agent",
    # Next, we pass in the function that will determine which node is called next.
    should_continue,
    # Finally we pass in a mapping.
    # The keys are strings, and the values are other nodes.
    # END is a special node marking that the graph should finish.
    # What will happen is we will call `should_continue`, and then the output of that
    # will be matched against the keys in this mapping.
    # Based on which one it matches, that node will then be called.
    {
        # If `tools`, then we call the tool node.
        "continue": "action",
        # Otherwise we finish.
        "end": END,
    },
)

# We now add a normal edge from `tools` to `agent`.
# This means that after `tools` is called, `agent` node is called next.
workflow.add_edge("action", "agent")

# Finally, we compile it!
# This compiles it into a LangChain Runnable,
# meaning you can use it as you would any other runnable
app = workflow.compile()

API Reference: END | StateGraph | START
from IPython.display import Image, display

display(Image(app.get_graph().draw_mermaid_png()))

Use it!¶
We can now use it!
This now exposes the same interface as all other LangChain runnables.
from langchain_core.messages import HumanMessage

inputs = {"messages": [HumanMessage(content="what is the weather in sf")]}
await app.ainvoke(inputs)

API Reference: HumanMessage
{'messages': [HumanMessage(content='what is the weather in sf', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, id='144d2b42-22e7-4697-8d87-ae45b2e15633'),
  AIMessage(content=[{'id': 'toolu_01DvcgvQpeNpEwG7VqvfFL4j', 'input': {'query': 'weather in san francisco'}, 'name': 'search', 'type': 'tool_use'}], additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={'id': 'msg_01Ke5ivtyU91W5RKnGS6BMvq', 'model': 'claude-3-haiku-20240307', 'stop_reason': 'tool_use', 'stop_sequence': None, 'usage': {'input_tokens': 328, 'output_tokens': 54}}, id='run-482de1f4-0e4b-4445-9b35-4be3221e3f82-0', tool_calls=[{'name': 'search', 'args': {'query': 'weather in san francisco'}, 'id': 'toolu_01DvcgvQpeNpEwG7VqvfFL4j', 'type': 'tool_call'}], usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 328, 'output_tokens': 54, 'total_tokens': 382}),

This may take a little bit - it's making a few calls behind the scenes.
In order to start seeing some intermediate results as they happen, we can use streaming - see below for more information on that.
Streaming¶
LangGraph has support for several different types of streaming.
Streaming Node Output¶
One of the benefits of using LangGraph is that it is easy to stream output as it's produced by each node.
inputs = {"messages": [HumanMessage(content="what is the weather in sf")]}
async for output in app.astream(inputs, stream_mode="updates"):
    # stream_mode="updates" yields dictionaries with output keyed by node name
    for key, value in output.items():
        print(f"Output from node '{key}':")
        print("---")
        print(value["messages"][-1].pretty_print())
    print("\n---\n")

Output from node 'agent':
---
==================================[1m Ai Message [0m==================================

[{'id': 'toolu_01R3qRoggjdwVLPjaqRgM5vA', 'input': {'query': 'weather in san francisco'}, 'name': 'search', 'type': 'tool_use'}]

The current weather in San Francisco is:

Current conditions: Partly cloudy 
Temperature: 62°F (17°C)
Wind: 12 mph (19 km/h) from the west
Chance of rain: 0%
Humidity: 73%

San Francisco has a mild Mediterranean climate. The city experiences cool, dry summers and mild, wet winters. Temperatures are moderated by the Pacific Ocean and the coastal location. Fog is common, especially during the summer months.

Does this help provide the weather information you were looking for in San Francisco? Let me know if you need any other details.
None

Streaming LLM Tokens¶
You can also access the LLM tokens as they are produced by each node. 
In this case only the "agent" node produces LLM tokens.
In order for this to work properly, you must be using an LLM that supports streaming as well as have set it when constructing the LLM (e.g. ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-3.5-turbo-1106", streaming=True))
inputs = {"messages": [HumanMessage(content="what is the weather in sf")]}
async for output in app.astream_log(inputs, include_types=["llm"]):
    # astream_log() yields the requested logs (here LLMs) in JSONPatch format
    for op in output.ops:
        if op["path"] == "/streamed_output/-":
            # this is the output from .stream()
            ...
        elif op["path"].startswith("/logs/") and op["path"].endswith(
            "/streamed_output/-"
        ):
            # because we chose to only include LLMs, these are LLM tokens
            try:
                content = op["value"].content[0]
                if "partial_json" in content:
                    print(content["partial_json"], end="|")
                elif "text" in content:
                    print(content["text"], end="|")
                else:
                    print(content, end="|")
            except:
                pass

{'id': 'toolu_01ULvL7VnwHg8DHTvdGCpuAM', 'input': {}, 'name': 'search', 'type': 'tool_use', 'index': 0}||{"|query": "wea|ther in |sf"}|

Base|d on the search results|, it looks| like the current| weather in San Francisco| is:

-| Partly| clou|dy with a high| of 65|°F (18|°C) an|d a low of |53|°F (12|°C). |

CONTENT:
How to add custom authentication¶

Prerequisites
This guide assumes familiarity with the following concepts:

Authentication & Access Control
LangGraph Platform

For a more guided walkthrough, see setting up custom authentication tutorial.

Support by deployment type
Custom auth is supported for all deployments in the managed LangGraph Cloud, as well as Enterprise self-hosted plans. It is not supported for Lite self-hosted plans.

This guide shows how to add custom authentication to your LangGraph Platform application. This guide applies to both LangGraph Cloud, BYOC, and self-hosted deployments. It does not apply to isolated usage of the LangGraph open source library in your own custom server.
1. Implement authentication¶
from langgraph_sdk import Auth

my_auth = Auth()

@my_auth.authenticate
async def authenticate(authorization: str) -> str:
    token = authorization.split(" ", 1)[-1] # "Bearer <token>"
    try:
        # Verify token with your auth provider
        user_id = await verify_token(token)
        return user_id
    except Exception:
        raise Auth.exceptions.HTTPException(
            status_code=401,
            detail="Invalid token"
        )

# Add authorization rules to actually control access to resources
@my_auth.on
async def add_owner(
    ctx: Auth.types.AuthContext,
    value: dict,
):
    """Add owner to resource metadata and filter by owner."""
    filters = {"owner": ctx.user.identity}
    metadata = value.setdefault("metadata", {})
    metadata.update(filters)
    return filters

# Assumes you organize information in store like (user_id, resource_type, resource_id)
@my_auth.on.store()
async def authorize_store(ctx: Auth.types.AuthContext, value: dict):
    namespace: tuple = value["namespace"]
    assert namespace[0] == ctx.user.identity, "Not authorized"

2. Update configuration¶
In your langgraph.json, add the path to your auth file:
{
  "dependencies": ["."],
  "graphs": {
    "agent": "./agent.py:graph"
  },
  "env": ".env",
  "auth": {
    "path": "./auth.py:my_auth"
  }
}

3. Connect from the client¶
Once you've set up authentication in your server, requests must include the the required authorization information based on your chosen scheme.
Assuming you are using JWT token authentication, you could access your deployments using any of the following methods:
Python ClientPython RemoteGraphJavaScript ClientJavaScript RemoteGraphCURL

from langgraph_sdk import get_client

my_token = "your-token" # In practice, you would generate a signed token with your auth provider
client = get_client(
    url="http://localhost:2024",
    headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {my_token}"}
)
threads = await client.threads.search()

from langgraph.pregel.remote import RemoteGraph

my_token = "your-token" # In practice, you would generate a signed token with your auth provider
remote_graph = RemoteGraph(
    "agent",
    url="http://localhost:2024",
    headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {my_token}"}
)
threads = await remote_graph.ainvoke(...)

import { Client } from "@langchain/langgraph-sdk";

const my_token = "your-token"; // In practice, you would generate a signed token with your auth provider
const client = new Client({
  apiUrl: "http://localhost:2024",
  headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${my_token}` },
});
const threads = await client.threads.search();

import { RemoteGraph } from "@langchain/langgraph/remote";

const my_token = "your-token"; // In practice, you would generate a signed token with your auth provider
const remoteGraph = new RemoteGraph({
  graphId: "agent",
  url: "http://localhost:2024",
  headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${my_token}` },
});
const threads = await remoteGraph.invoke(...);

curl -H "Authorization: Bearer ${your-token}" http://localhost:2024/threads

How to force tool-calling agent to structure output¶

Prerequisites

        This guide assumes familiarity with the following:
        

                    Structured Output
                

                    Tool calling agent
                

                    Chat Models
                

                    Messages
                

                    LangGraph Glossary
                

You might want your agent to return its output in a structured format. For example, if the output of the agent is used by some other downstream software, you may want the output to be in the same structured format every time the agent is invoked to ensure consistency.
This notebook will walk through two different options for forcing a tool calling agent to structure its output. We will be using a basic ReAct agent (a model node and a tool-calling node) together with a third node at the end that will format response for the user. Both of the options will use the same graph structure as shown in the diagram below, but will have different mechanisms under the hood.

Option 1

The first way you can force your tool calling agent to have structured output is to bind the output you would like as an additional tool for the agent node to use. In contrast to the basic ReAct agent, the agent node in this case is not selecting between tools and END but rather selecting between the specific tools it calls. The expected flow in this case is that the LLM in the agent node will first select the action tool, and after receiving the action tool output it will call the response tool, which will then route to the respond node which simply structures the arguments from the agent node tool call.
Pros and Cons
The benefit to this format is that you only need one LLM, and can save money and latency because of this. The downside to this option is that it isn't guaranteed that the single LLM will call the correct tool when you want it to. We can help the LLM by setting tool_choice to any when we use bind_tools which forces the LLM to select at least one tool at every turn, but this is far from a foolproof strategy. In addition, another downside is that the agent might call multiple tools, so we need to check for this explicitly in our routing function (or if we are using OpenAI we can set parallell_tool_calling=False to ensure only one tool is called at a time).
Option 2

The second way you can force your tool calling agent to have structured output is to use a second LLM (in this case model_with_structured_output) to respond to the user. 
In this case, you will define a basic ReAct agent normally, but instead of having the agent node choose between the tools node and ending the conversation, the agent node will choose between the tools node and the respond node. The respond node will contain a second LLM that uses structured output, and once called will return directly to the user. You can think of this method as basic ReAct with one extra step before responding to the user. 
Pros and Cons
The benefit of this method is that it guarantees structured output (as long as .with_structured_output works as expected with the LLM). The downside to using this approach is that it requires making an additional LLM call before responding to the user, which can increase costs as well as latency. In addition, by not providing the agent node LLM with information about the desired output schema there is a risk that the agent LLM will fail to call the correct tools required to answer in the correct output schema.
Note that both of these options will follow the exact same graph structure (see the diagram above), in that they are both exact replicas of the basic ReAct architecture but with a respond node before the end.
Setup¶
First, let's install the required packages and set our API keys
%%capture --no-stderr
%pip install -U langgraph langchain_anthropic

import getpass
import os

def _set_env(var: str):
    if not os.environ.get(var):
        os.environ[var] = getpass.getpass(f"{var}: ")

_set_env("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY")

        Sign up for LangSmith to quickly spot issues and improve the performance of your LangGraph projects. LangSmith lets you use trace data to debug, test, and monitor your LLM apps built with LangGraph — read more about how to get started here. 
    

Define model, tools, and graph state¶
Now we can define how we want to structure our output, define our graph state, and also our tools and the models we are going to use.
To use structured output, we will use the with_structured_output method from LangChain, which you can read more about here.
We are going to use a single tool in this example for finding the weather, and will return a structured weather response to the user.
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from typing import Literal
from langchain_core.tools import tool
from langchain_anthropic import ChatAnthropic
from langgraph.graph import MessagesState

class WeatherResponse(BaseModel):
    """Respond to the user with this"""

    temperature: float = Field(description="The temperature in fahrenheit")
    wind_directon: str = Field(
        description="The direction of the wind in abbreviated form"
    )
    wind_speed: float = Field(description="The speed of the wind in km/h")

# Inherit 'messages' key from MessagesState, which is a list of chat messages
class AgentState(MessagesState):
    # Final structured response from the agent
    final_response: WeatherResponse

@tool
def get_weather(city: Literal["nyc", "sf"]):
    """Use this to get weather information."""
    if city == "nyc":
        return "It is cloudy in NYC, with 5 mph winds in the North-East direction and a temperature of 70 degrees"
    elif city == "sf":
        return "It is 75 degrees and sunny in SF, with 3 mph winds in the South-East direction"
    else:
        raise AssertionError("Unknown city")

tools = [get_weather]

model = ChatAnthropic(model="claude-3-opus-20240229")

model_with_tools = model.bind_tools(tools)
model_with_structured_output = model.with_structured_output(WeatherResponse)

API Reference: tool | ChatAnthropic
Option 1: Bind output as tool¶
Let's now examine how we would use the single LLM option.
Define Graph¶
The graph definition is very similar to the one above, the only difference is we no longer call an LLM in the response node, and instead bind the WeatherResponse tool to our LLM that already contains the get_weather tool.
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, END
from langgraph.prebuilt import ToolNode

tools = [get_weather, WeatherResponse]

# Force the model to use tools by passing tool_choice="any"
model_with_response_tool = model.bind_tools(tools, tool_choice="any")

# Define the function that calls the model
def call_model(state: AgentState):
    response = model_with_response_tool.invoke(state["messages"])
    # We return a list, because this will get added to the existing list
    return {"messages": [response]}

# Define the function that responds to the user
def respond(state: AgentState):
    # Construct the final answer from the arguments of the last tool call
    weather_tool_call = state["messages"][-1].tool_calls[0]
    response = WeatherResponse(**weather_tool_call["args"])
    # Since we're using tool calling to return structured output,
    # we need to add  a tool message corresponding to the WeatherResponse tool call,
    # This is due to LLM providers' requirement that AI messages with tool calls
    # need to be followed by a tool message for each tool call
    tool_message = {
        "type": "tool",
        "content": "Here is your structured response",
        "tool_call_id": weather_tool_call["id"],
    }
    # We return the final answer
    return {"final_response": response, "messages": [tool_message]}

# Define the function that determines whether to continue or not
def should_continue(state: AgentState):
    messages = state["messages"]
    last_message = messages[-1]
    # If there is only one tool call and it is the response tool call we respond to the user
    if (
        len(last_message.tool_calls) == 1
        and last_message.tool_calls[0]["name"] == "WeatherResponse"
    ):
        return "respond"
    # Otherwise we will use the tool node again
    else:
        return "continue"

# Define a new graph
workflow = StateGraph(AgentState)

# Define the two nodes we will cycle between
workflow.add_node("agent", call_model)
workflow.add_node("respond", respond)
workflow.add_node("tools", ToolNode(tools))

# Set the entrypoint as `agent`
# This means that this node is the first one called
workflow.set_entry_point("agent")

# We now add a conditional edge
workflow.add_conditional_edges(
    "agent",
    should_continue,
    {
        "continue": "tools",
        "respond": "respond",
    },
)

workflow.add_edge("tools", "agent")
workflow.add_edge("respond", END)
graph = workflow.compile()

API Reference: StateGraph | END | ToolNode
Usage¶
Now we can run our graph to check that it worked as intended:
answer = graph.invoke(input={"messages": [("human", "what's the weather in SF?")]})[
    "final_response"
]

answer

WeatherResponse(temperature=75.0, wind_directon='SE', wind_speed=3.0)

Again, the agent returned a WeatherResponse object as we expected.
Option 2: 2 LLMs¶
Let's now dive into how we would use a second LLM to force structured output.
Define Graph¶
We can now define our graph:
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, END
from langgraph.prebuilt import ToolNode
from langchain_core.messages import HumanMessage

# Define the function that calls the model
def call_model(state: AgentState):
    response = model_with_tools.invoke(state["messages"])
    # We return a list, because this will get added to the existing list
    return {"messages": [response]}

# Define the function that responds to the user
def respond(state: AgentState):
    # We call the model with structured output in order to return the same format to the user every time
    # state['messages'][-2] is the last ToolMessage in the convo, which we convert to a HumanMessage for the model to use
    # We could also pass the entire chat history, but this saves tokens since all we care to structure is the output of the tool
    response = model_with_structured_output.invoke(
        [HumanMessage(content=state["messages"][-2].content)]
    )
    # We return the final answer
    return {"final_response": response}

# Define the function that determines whether to continue or not
def should_continue(state: AgentState):
    messages = state["messages"]
    last_message = messages[-1]
    # If there is no function call, then we respond to the user
    if not last_message.tool_calls:
        return "respond"
    # Otherwise if there is, we continue
    else:
        return "continue"

# Define a new graph
workflow = StateGraph(AgentState)

# Define the two nodes we will cycle between
workflow.add_node("agent", call_model)
workflow.add_node("respond", respond)
workflow.add_node("tools", ToolNode(tools))

# Set the entrypoint as `agent`
# This means that this node is the first one called
workflow.set_entry_point("agent")

# We now add a conditional edge
workflow.add_conditional_edges(
    "agent",
    should_continue,
    {
        "continue": "tools",
        "respond": "respond",
    },
)

workflow.add_edge("tools", "agent")
workflow.add_edge("respond", END)
graph = workflow.compile()

API Reference: StateGraph | END | ToolNode | HumanMessage
Usage¶
We can now invoke our graph to verify that the output is being structured as desired:
answer = graph.invoke(input={"messages": [("human", "what's the weather in SF?")]})[
    "final_response"
]

answer

WeatherResponse(temperature=75.0, wind_directon='SE', wind_speed=4.83)

As we can see, the agent returned a WeatherResponse object as we expected. If would now be easy to use this agent in a more complex software stack without having to worry about the output of the agent not matching the format expected from the next step in the stack.

How to integrate LangGraph with AutoGen, CrewAI, and other frameworks¶
LangGraph is a framework for building agentic and multi-agent applications. LangGraph can be easily integrated with other agent frameworks. 
The primary reasons you might want to integrate LangGraph with other agent frameworks:

create multi-agent systems where individual agents are built with different frameworks
leverage LangGraph to add features like persistence, streaming, short and long-term memory and more

The simplest way to integrate agents from other frameworks is by calling those agents inside a LangGraph node:
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, MessagesState, START

autogen_agent = autogen.AssistantAgent(name="assistant", ...)
user_proxy = autogen.UserProxyAgent(name="user_proxy", ...)

def call_autogen_agent(state: MessagesState):
    response = user_proxy.initiate_chat(
        autogen_agent,
        message=state["messages"][-1],
        ...
    )
    ...

graph = (
    StateGraph(MessagesState)
    .add_node(call_autogen_agent)
    .add_edge(START, "call_autogen_agent")
    .compile()
)

graph.invoke({
    "messages": [
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Find numbers between 10 and 30 in fibonacci sequence",
        }
    ]
})

In this guide we show how to build a LangGraph chatbot that integrates with AutoGen, but you can follow the same approach with other frameworks.
Setup¶
%pip install autogen langgraph

import getpass
import os

def _set_env(var: str):
    if not os.environ.get(var):
        os.environ[var] = getpass.getpass(f"{var}: ")

_set_env("OPENAI_API_KEY")

OPENAI_API_KEY:  ········

Define AutoGen agent¶
Here we define our AutoGen agent. Adapted from official tutorial here.
import autogen
import os

config_list = [{"model": "gpt-4o", "api_key": os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"]}]

llm_config = {
    "timeout": 600,
    "cache_seed": 42,
    "config_list": config_list,
    "temperature": 0,
}

autogen_agent = autogen.AssistantAgent(
    name="assistant",
    llm_config=llm_config,
)

user_proxy = autogen.UserProxyAgent(
    name="user_proxy",
    human_input_mode="NEVER",
    max_consecutive_auto_reply=10,
    is_termination_msg=lambda x: x.get("content", "").rstrip().endswith("TERMINATE"),
    code_execution_config={
        "work_dir": "web",
        "use_docker": False,
    },  # Please set use_docker=True if docker is available to run the generated code. Using docker is safer than running the generated code directly.
    llm_config=llm_config,
    system_message="Reply TERMINATE if the task has been solved at full satisfaction. Otherwise, reply CONTINUE, or the reason why the task is not solved yet.",
)

Create the graph¶
We will now create a LangGraph chatbot graph that calls AutoGen agent.
from langchain_core.messages import convert_to_openai_messages
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, MessagesState, START
from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver

def call_autogen_agent(state: MessagesState):
    # convert to openai-style messages
    messages = convert_to_openai_messages(state["messages"])
    response = user_proxy.initiate_chat(
        autogen_agent,
        message=messages[-1],
        # pass previous message history as context
        carryover=messages[:-1],
    )
    # get the final response from the agent
    content = response.chat_history[-1]["content"]
    return {"messages": {"role": "assistant", "content": content}}

# add short-term memory for storing conversation history
checkpointer = MemorySaver()

builder = StateGraph(MessagesState)
builder.add_node(call_autogen_agent)
builder.add_edge(START, "call_autogen_agent")
graph = builder.compile(checkpointer=checkpointer)

API Reference: convert_to_openai_messages | StateGraph | START | MemorySaver
from IPython.display import display, Image

display(Image(graph.get_graph().draw_mermaid_png()))

Run the graph¶
We can now run the graph.
# pass the thread ID to persist agent outputs for future interactions
config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "1"}}

for chunk in graph.stream(
    {
        "messages": [
            {
                "role": "user",
                "content": "Find numbers between 10 and 30 in fibonacci sequence",
            }
        ]
    },
    config,

    print(chunk)

Find numbers between 10 and 30 in fibonacci sequence

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[33massistant[0m (to user_proxy):

To find numbers between 10 and 30 in the Fibonacci sequence, we can generate the Fibonacci sequence and check which numbers fall within this range. Here's a plan:

1. Generate Fibonacci numbers starting from 0.
2. Continue generating until the numbers exceed 30.
3. Collect and print the numbers that are between 10 and 30.

Let's implement this in Python:

\`\`\`python
# filename: fibonacci_range.py

def fibonacci_sequence():
    a, b = 0, 1
    while a <= 30:
        if 10 <= a <= 30:
            print(a)
        a, b = b, a + b

fibonacci_sequence()
\`\`\`

This script will print the Fibonacci numbers between 10 and 30. Please execute the code to see the result.

Code output:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[33massistant[0m (to user_proxy):

The Fibonacci numbers between 10 and 30 are 13 and 21. 

These numbers are part of the Fibonacci sequence, which is generated by adding the two preceding numbers to get the next number, starting from 0 and 1. 

The sequence goes: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ...

As you can see, 13 and 21 are the only numbers in this sequence that fall between 10 and 30.

TERMINATE

{'call_autogen_agent': {'messages': {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'The Fibonacci numbers between 10 and 30 are 13 and 21. \n\nThese numbers are part of the Fibonacci sequence, which is generated by adding the two preceding numbers to get the next number, starting from 0 and 1. \n\nThe sequence goes: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ...\n\nAs you can see, 13 and 21 are the only numbers in this sequence that fall between 10 and 30.\n\nTERMINATE'}}}

Since we're leveraging LangGraph's persistence features we can now continue the conversation using the same thread ID -- LangGraph will automatically pass previous history to the AutoGen agent:

CONTENT:
How to pass custom run ID or set tags and metadata for graph runs in LangSmith¶

Prerequisites

        This guide assumes familiarity with the following:
        

                    LangSmith Documentation
                

                    LangSmith Platform
                

                    RunnableConfig
                

                    Add metadata and tags to traces
                

                    Customize run name
                

Debugging graph runs can sometimes be difficult to do in an IDE or terminal. LangSmith lets you use trace data to debug, test, and monitor your LLM apps built with LangGraph — read the LangSmith documentation for more information on how to get started.
To make it easier to identify and analyzed traces generated during graph invocation, you can set additional configuration at run time (see RunnableConfig):

Field
Type
Description

run_name
str
Name for the tracer run for this call. Defaults to the name of the class.

run_id
UUID
Unique identifier for the tracer run for this call. If not provided, a new UUID will be generated.

tags
List[str]
Tags for this call and any sub-calls (e.g., a Chain calling an LLM). You can use these to filter calls.

metadata
Dict[str, Any]
Metadata for this call and any sub-calls (e.g., a Chain calling an LLM). Keys should be strings, values should be JSON-serializable.

LangGraph graphs implement the LangChain Runnable Interface and accept a second argument (RunnableConfig) in methods like invoke, ainvoke, stream etc.
The LangSmith platform will allow you to search and filter traces based on run_name, run_id, tags and metadata.
TLDR¶
import uuid
# Generate a random UUID -- it must be a UUID
config = {"run_id": uuid.uuid4()}, "tags": ["my_tag1"], "metadata": {"a": 5}}
# Works with all standard Runnable methods 
# like invoke, batch, ainvoke, astream_events etc
graph.stream(inputs, config, stream_mode="values")

The rest of the how to guide will show a full agent.
Setup¶
First, let's install the required packages and set our API keys
%%capture --no-stderr
%pip install --quiet -U langgraph langchain_openai

import getpass
import os

def _set_env(var: str):
    if not os.environ.get(var):
        os.environ[var] = getpass.getpass(f"{var}: ")

_set_env("OPENAI_API_KEY")
_set_env("LANGSMITH_API_KEY")

Set up LangSmith for LangGraph development

        Sign up for LangSmith to quickly spot issues and improve the performance of your LangGraph projects. LangSmith lets you use trace data to debug, test, and monitor your LLM apps built with LangGraph — read more about how to get started here. 
    

Define the graph¶
For this example we will use the prebuilt ReAct agent.
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from typing import Literal
from langgraph.prebuilt import create_react_agent
from langchain_core.tools import tool

# First we initialize the model we want to use.
model = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o", temperature=0)

# For this tutorial we will use custom tool that returns pre-defined values for weather in two cities (NYC & SF)
@tool
def get_weather(city: Literal["nyc", "sf"]):
    """Use this to get weather information."""
    if city == "nyc":
        return "It might be cloudy in nyc"
    elif city == "sf":
        return "It's always sunny in sf"
    else:
        raise AssertionError("Unknown city")

tools = [get_weather]

# Define the graph
graph = create_react_agent(model, tools=tools)

API Reference: ChatOpenAI | create_react_agent | tool
Run your graph¶
Now that we've defined our graph let's run it once and view the trace in LangSmith. In order for our trace to be easily accessible in LangSmith, we will pass in a custom run_id in the config.
This assumes that you have set your LANGSMITH_API_KEY environment variable.
Note that you can also configure what project to trace to by setting the LANGCHAIN_PROJECT environment variable, by default runs will be traced to the default project.
import uuid

def print_stream(stream):
    for s in stream:
        message = s["messages"][-1]
        if isinstance(message, tuple):
            print(message)
        else:
            message.pretty_print()

inputs = {"messages": [("user", "what is the weather in sf")]}

config = {"run_name": "agent_007", "tags": ["cats are awesome"]}

print_stream(graph.stream(inputs, config, stream_mode="values"))

================================[1m Human Message [0m=================================

what is the weather in sf
==================================[1m Ai Message [0m==================================
Tool Calls:
  get_weather (call_9ZudXyMAdlUjptq9oMGtQo8o)
 Call ID: call_9ZudXyMAdlUjptq9oMGtQo8o
  Args:

=================================[1m Tool Message [0m=================================
Name: get_weather

It's always sunny in sf
==================================[1m Ai Message [0m==================================

The weather in San Francisco is currently sunny.

View the trace in LangSmith¶
Now that we've ran our graph, let's head over to LangSmith and view our trace. First click into the project that you traced to (in our case the default project). You should see a run with the custom run name "agent_007".

In addition, you will be able to filter traces after the fact using the tags or metadata provided. For example,

How to connect a local agent to LangGraph Studio¶
This guide shows you how to connect your local agent to LangGraph Studio for visualization, interaction, and debugging using the development server.
Setup your application¶
First, you will need to setup your application in the proper format.
This means defining a langgraph.json file which contains paths to your agent(s).
See this guide for information on how to do so.
Install langgraph-cli¶
You will need to install langgraph-cli (version 0.1.55 or higher).
You will need to make sure to install the inmem extras.

Minimum version

The minimum version to use the inmem extra with langgraph-cli is 0.1.55.
Python 3.11 or higher is required.
pip install -U "langgraph-cli[inmem]"

Run the development server¶

Navigate to your project directory (where langgraph.json is located)

Start the server:
   langgraph dev

This will look for the langgraph.json file in your current directory.
In there, it will find the paths to the graph(s), and start those up.
It will then automatically connect to the cloud-hosted studio.
Use the studio¶
After connecting to the studio, a browser window should automatically pop up.
This will use the cloud hosted studio UI to connect to your local development server.
Your graph is still running locally, the UI is connecting to visualizing the agent and threads that are defined locally.
The graph will always use the most up-to-date code, so you will be able to change the underlying code and have it automatically reflected in the studio.
This is useful for debugging workflows.
You can run your graph in the UI until it messes up, go in and change your code, and then rerun from the node that failed.
(Optional) Attach a debugger¶
For step-by-step debugging with breakpoints and variable inspection:
# Install debugpy package
pip install debugpy

# Start server with debugging enabled
langgraph dev --debug-port 5678

Then attach your preferred debugger:
VS CodePyCharm

Add this configuration to launch.json:
{
  "name": "Attach to LangGraph",
  "type": "debugpy",
  "request": "attach",
  "connect": {
    "host": "0.0.0.0",
    "port": 5678
  }
}

Specify the port number you chose in the previous step.

Go to Run → Edit Configurations
Click + and select "Python Debug Server"
Set IDE host name: localhost
Set port: 5678 (or the port number you chose in the previous step)
Click "OK" and start debugging

CONTENT:
How to use LangGraph Platform to deploy CrewAI, AutoGen, and other frameworks¶
LangGraph Platform provides infrastructure for deploying agents. This integrates seamlessly with LangGraph, but can also work with other frameworks. The way to make this work is to wrap the agent in a single LangGraph node, and have that be the entire graph.
Doing so will allow you to deploy to LangGraph Platform, and allows you to get a lot of the benefits. You get horizontally scalable infrastructure, a task queue to handle bursty operations, a persistence layer to power short term memory, and long term memory support.
In this guide we show how to do this with an AutoGen agent, but this method should work for agents defined in other frameworks like CrewAI, LlamaIndex, and others as well.
Setup¶
%pip install autogen langgraph

import getpass
import os

def _set_env(var: str):
    if not os.environ.get(var):
        os.environ[var] = getpass.getpass(f"{var}: ")

_set_env("OPENAI_API_KEY")

Define autogen agent¶
Here we define our AutoGen agent. From https://github.com/microsoft/autogen/blob/0.2/notebook/agentchat_web_info.ipynb
import autogen
import os

config_list = [{"model": "gpt-4o", "api_key": os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"]}]

llm_config = {
    "timeout": 600,
    "cache_seed": 42,
    "config_list": config_list,
    "temperature": 0,
}

autogen_agent = autogen.AssistantAgent(
    name="assistant",
    llm_config=llm_config,
)

user_proxy = autogen.UserProxyAgent(
    name="user_proxy",
    human_input_mode="NEVER",
    max_consecutive_auto_reply=10,
    is_termination_msg=lambda x: x.get("content", "").rstrip().endswith("TERMINATE"),
    code_execution_config={
        "work_dir": "web",
        "use_docker": False,
    },  # Please set use_docker=True if docker is available to run the generated code. Using docker is safer than running the generated code directly.
    llm_config=llm_config,
    system_message="Reply TERMINATE if the task has been solved at full satisfaction. Otherwise, reply CONTINUE, or the reason why the task is not solved yet.",
)

Wrap in LangGraph¶
We now wrap the AutoGen agent in a single LangGraph node, and make that the entire graph.
The main thing this involves is defining an Input and Output schema for the node, which you would need to do if deploying this manually, so it's no extra work
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, MessagesState

def call_autogen_agent(state: MessagesState):
    last_message = state["messages"][-1]
    response = user_proxy.initiate_chat(autogen_agent, message=last_message.content)
    # get the final response from the agent
    content = response.chat_history[-1]["content"]
    return {"messages": {"role": "assistant", "content": content}}

graph = StateGraph(MessagesState)
graph.add_node(call_autogen_agent)
graph.set_entry_point("call_autogen_agent")
graph = graph.compile()

API Reference: StateGraph
Deploy with LangGraph Platform¶
You can now deploy this as you normally would with LangGraph Platform. See these instructions for more details.

CONTENT:
How to add TTLs to your LangGraph application¶

Prerequisites
This guide assumes familiarity with the LangGraph Platform, Persistence, and Cross-thread persistence concepts.

LangGraph platform only
TTLs are only supported for LangGraph platform deployments. This guide does not apply to LangGraph OSS.

The LangGraph Platform persists both checkpoints (thread state) and cross-thread memories (store items). Configure Time-to-Live (TTL) policies in langgraph.json to automatically manage the lifecycle of this data, preventing indefinite accumulation.
Configuring Checkpoint TTL¶
Checkpoints capture the state of conversation threads. Setting a TTL ensures old checkpoints and threads are automatically deleted.
Add a checkpointer.ttl configuration to your langgraph.json file:
{
  "dependencies": ["."],
  "graphs": {
    "agent": "./agent.py:graph"
  },
  "checkpointer": {
    "ttl": {
      "strategy": "delete",
      "sweep_interval_minutes": 60,
      "default_ttl": 43200 
    }
  }
}

strategy: Specifies the action taken on expiration. Currently, only "delete" is supported, which deletes all checkpoints in the thread upon expiration.
sweep_interval_minutes: Defines how often, in minutes, the system checks for expired checkpoints.
default_ttl: Sets the default lifespan of checkpoints in minutes (e.g., 43200 minutes = 30 days).

Configuring Store Item TTL¶
Store items allow cross-thread data persistence. Configuring TTL for store items helps manage memory by removing stale data.
Add a store.ttl configuration to your langgraph.json file:
{
  "dependencies": ["."],
  "graphs": {
    "agent": "./agent.py:graph"
  },
  "store": {
    "ttl": {
      "refresh_on_read": true,
      "sweep_interval_minutes": 120,
      "default_ttl": 10080
    }
  }
}

refresh_on_read: (Optional, default true) If true, accessing an item via get or search resets its expiration timer. If false, TTL only refreshes on put.
sweep_interval_minutes: (Optional) Defines how often, in minutes, the system checks for expired items. If omitted, no sweeping occurs.
default_ttl: (Optional) Sets the default lifespan of store items in minutes (e.g., 10080 minutes = 7 days). If omitted, items do not expire by default.

Combining TTL Configurations¶
You can configure TTLs for both checkpoints and store items in the same langgraph.json file to set different policies for each data type. Here is an example:
{
  "dependencies": ["."],
  "graphs": {
    "agent": "./agent.py:graph"
  },
  "checkpointer": {
    "ttl": {
      "strategy": "delete",
      "sweep_interval_minutes": 60,
      "default_ttl": 43200
    }
  },
  "store": {
    "ttl": {
      "refresh_on_read": true,
      "sweep_interval_minutes": 120,
      "default_ttl": 10080
    }
  }
}

Runtime Overrides¶
The default store.ttl settings from langgraph.json can be overridden at runtime by providing specific TTL values in SDK method calls like get, put, and search.
Deployment Process¶
After configuring TTLs in langgraph.json, deploy or restart your LangGraph application for the changes to take effect. Use langgraph dev for local development or langgraph up for Docker deployment.
See the langgraph.json CLI reference for more details on the other configurable options.

CONTENT:
How to document API authentication in OpenAPI¶
This guide shows how to customize the OpenAPI security schema for your LangGraph Platform API documentation. A well-documented security schema helps API consumers understand how to authenticate with your API and even enables automatic client generation. See the Authentication & Access Control conceptual guide for more details about LangGraph's authentication system.

Implementation vs Documentation
This guide only covers how to document your security requirements in OpenAPI. To implement the actual authentication logic, see How to add custom authentication.

This guide applies to all LangGraph Platform deployments (Cloud, BYOC, and self-hosted). It does not apply to usage of the LangGraph open source library if you are not using LangGraph Platform.
Default Schema¶
The default security scheme varies by deployment type:
LangGraph Cloud

By default, LangGraph Cloud requires a LangSmith API key in the x-api-key header:
components:
  securitySchemes:
    apiKeyAuth:
      type: apiKey
      in: header
      name: x-api-key
security:
  - apiKeyAuth: []

When using one of the LangGraph SDK's, this can be inferred from environment variables.
Self-hosted

By default, self-hosted deployments have no security scheme. This means they are to be deployed only on a secured network or with authentication. To add custom authentication, see How to add custom authentication.
Custom Security Schema¶
To customize the security schema in your OpenAPI documentation, add an openapi field to your auth configuration in langgraph.json. Remember that this only updates the API documentation - you must also implement the corresponding authentication logic as shown in How to add custom authentication.
Note that LangGraph Platform does not provide authentication endpoints - you'll need to handle user authentication in your client application and pass the resulting credentials to the LangGraph API.
OAuth2 with Bearer TokenAPI Key

{
  "auth": {
    "path": "./auth.py:my_auth",  // Implement auth logic here
    "openapi": {
      "securitySchemes": {
        "OAuth2": {
          "type": "oauth2",

          "type": "apiKey",

        }
      },
      "security": [
        {"apiKeyAuth": []}
      ]
    }
  }
}

Testing¶
After updating your configuration:

Deploy your application
Visit /docs to see the updated OpenAPI documentation
Try out the endpoints using credentials from your authentication server (make sure you've implemented the authentication logic first)

SOURCE: https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/tutorials/workflows/
CONTENT:
Workflows and Agents¶
This guide reviews common patterns for agentic systems. In describing these systems, it can be useful to make a distinction between "workflows" and "agents". One way to think about this difference is nicely explained in Anthropic's Building Effective Agents blog post:

Workflows are systems where LLMs and tools are orchestrated through predefined code paths.
Agents, on the other hand, are systems where LLMs dynamically direct their own processes and tool usage, maintaining control over how they accomplish tasks.

Here is a simple way to visualize these differences:

When building agents and workflows, LangGraph offers a number of benefits including persistence, streaming, and support for debugging as well as deployment.
Set up¶
You can use any chat model that supports structured outputs and tool calling. Below, we show the process of installing the packages, setting API keys, and testing structured outputs / tool calling for Anthropic.

Install dependencies
pip install langchain_core langchain-anthropic langgraph 

Initialize an LLM
import os
import getpass

from langchain_anthropic import ChatAnthropic

def _set_env(var: str):
    if not os.environ.get(var):
        os.environ[var] = getpass.getpass(f"{var}: ")

_set_env("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY")

llm = ChatAnthropic(model="claude-3-5-sonnet-latest")

API Reference: ChatAnthropic
Building Blocks: The Augmented LLM¶
LLM have augmentations that support building workflows and agents. These include structured outputs and tool calling, as shown in this image from the Anthropic blog on Building Effective Agents:

# Schema for structured output
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

class SearchQuery(BaseModel):
    search_query: str = Field(None, description="Query that is optimized web search.")
    justification: str = Field(
        None, description="Why this query is relevant to the user's request."
    )

# Augment the LLM with schema for structured output
structured_llm = llm.with_structured_output(SearchQuery)

# Invoke the augmented LLM
output = structured_llm.invoke("How does Calcium CT score relate to high cholesterol?")

# Define a tool
def multiply(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    return a * b

# Augment the LLM with tools
llm_with_tools = llm.bind_tools([multiply])

# Invoke the LLM with input that triggers the tool call
msg = llm_with_tools.invoke("What is 2 times 3?")

# Get the tool call
msg.tool_calls

Prompt chaining¶
In prompt chaining, each LLM call processes the output of the previous one. 
As noted in the Anthropic blog on Building Effective Agents: 

Prompt chaining decomposes a task into a sequence of steps, where each LLM call processes the output of the previous one. You can add programmatic checks (see "gate” in the diagram below) on any intermediate steps to ensure that the process is still on track.
When to use this workflow: This workflow is ideal for situations where the task can be easily and cleanly decomposed into fixed subtasks. The main goal is to trade off latency for higher accuracy, by making each LLM call an easier task.

With parallelization, LLMs work simultaneously on a task:

LLMs can sometimes work simultaneously on a task and have their outputs aggregated programmatically. This workflow, parallelization, manifests in two key variations: Sectioning: Breaking a task into independent subtasks run in parallel. Voting: Running the same task multiple times to get diverse outputs.
When to use this workflow: Parallelization is effective when the divided subtasks can be parallelized for speed, or when multiple perspectives or attempts are needed for higher confidence results. For complex tasks with multiple considerations, LLMs generally perform better when each consideration is handled by a separate LLM call, allowing focused attention on each specific aspect.

Routing¶
Routing classifies an input and directs it to a followup task. As noted in the Anthropic blog on Building Effective Agents: 

Routing classifies an input and directs it to a specialized followup task. This workflow allows for separation of concerns, and building more specialized prompts. Without this workflow, optimizing for one kind of input can hurt performance on other inputs.
When to use this workflow: Routing works well for complex tasks where there are distinct categories that are better handled separately, and where classification can be handled accurately, either by an LLM or a more traditional classification model/algorithm.

Orchestrator-Worker¶
With orchestrator-worker, an orchestrator breaks down a task and delegates each sub-task to workers. As noted in the Anthropic blog on Building Effective Agents: 

In the orchestrator-workers workflow, a central LLM dynamically breaks down tasks, delegates them to worker LLMs, and synthesizes their results.
When to use this workflow: This workflow is well-suited for complex tasks where you can’t predict the subtasks needed (in coding, for example, the number of files that need to be changed and the nature of the change in each file likely depend on the task). Whereas it’s topographically similar, the key difference from parallelization is its flexibility—subtasks aren't pre-defined, but determined by the orchestrator based on the specific input.

Graph APIFunctional API

from typing import Annotated, List
import operator

# Schema for structured output to use in planning
class Section(BaseModel):
    name: str = Field(
        description="Name for this section of the report.",

    description: str = Field(
        description="Brief overview of the main topics and concepts to be covered in this section.",

    sections: List[Section] = Field(
        description="Sections of the report.",
    )

# Augment the LLM with schema for structured output
planner = llm.with_structured_output(Sections)

Creating Workers in LangGraph
Because orchestrator-worker workflows are common, LangGraph has the Send API to support this. It lets you dynamically create worker nodes and send each one a specific input. Each worker has its own state, and all worker outputs are written to a shared state key that is accessible to the orchestrator graph. This gives the orchestrator access to all worker output and allows it to synthesize them into a final output. As you can see below, we iterate over a list of sections and Send each to a worker node. See further documentation here and here.

Evaluator-optimizer¶
In the evaluator-optimizer workflow, one LLM call generates a response while another provides evaluation and feedback in a loop:

In the evaluator-optimizer workflow, one LLM call generates a response while another provides evaluation and feedback in a loop.
When to use this workflow: This workflow is particularly effective when we have clear evaluation criteria, and when iterative refinement provides measurable value. The two signs of good fit are, first, that LLM responses can be demonstrably improved when a human articulates their feedback; and second, that the LLM can provide such feedback. This is analogous to the iterative writing process a human writer might go through when producing a polished document.

Agent¶
Agents are typically implemented as an LLM performing actions (via tool-calling) based on environmental feedback in a loop. As noted in the Anthropic blog on Building Effective Agents:

Agents can handle sophisticated tasks, but their implementation is often straightforward. They are typically just LLMs using tools based on environmental feedback in a loop. It is therefore crucial to design toolsets and their documentation clearly and thoughtfully.
When to use agents: Agents can be used for open-ended problems where it’s difficult or impossible to predict the required number of steps, and where you can’t hardcode a fixed path. The LLM will potentially operate for many turns, and you must have some level of trust in its decision-making. Agents' autonomy makes them ideal for scaling tasks in trusted environments.

🚀 LangGraph Quickstart¶
In this tutorial, we will build a support chatbot in LangGraph that can:
✅ Answer common questions by searching the web
✅ Maintain conversation state across calls
✅ Route complex queries to a human for review
✅ Use custom state to control its behavior
✅ Rewind and explore alternative conversation paths  
We'll start with a basic chatbot and progressively add more sophisticated capabilities, introducing key LangGraph concepts along the way. Let’s dive in! 🌟
Setup¶
First, install the required packages and configure your environment:
%%capture --no-stderr
%pip install -U langgraph langsmith langchain_anthropic

import getpass
import os

def _set_env(var: str):
    if not os.environ.get(var):
        os.environ[var] = getpass.getpass(f"{var}: ")

_set_env("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY")

Set up LangSmith for LangGraph development

        Sign up for LangSmith to quickly spot issues and improve the performance of your LangGraph projects. LangSmith lets you use trace data to debug, test, and monitor your LLM apps built with LangGraph — read more about how to get started here. 
    

Part 1: Build a Basic Chatbot¶
We'll first create a simple chatbot using LangGraph. This chatbot will respond directly to user messages. Though simple, it will illustrate the core concepts of building with LangGraph. By the end of this section, you will have a built rudimentary chatbot.
Start by creating a StateGraph. A StateGraph object defines the structure of our chatbot as a "state machine". We'll add nodes to represent the llm and functions our chatbot can call and edges to specify how the bot should transition between these functions.
from typing import Annotated

from typing_extensions import TypedDict

from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END
from langgraph.graph.message import add_messages

class State(TypedDict):
    # Messages have the type "list". The `add_messages` function
    # in the annotation defines how this state key should be updated
    # (in this case, it appends messages to the list, rather than overwriting them)
    messages: Annotated[list, add_messages]

graph_builder = StateGraph(State)

API Reference: StateGraph | START | END | add_messages
Our graph can now handle two key tasks:

Each node can receive the current State as input and output an update to the state.
Updates to messages will be appended to the existing list rather than overwriting it, thanks to the prebuilt add_messages function used with the Annotated syntax.

Concept
When defining a graph, the first step is to define its State. The State includes the graph's schema and reducer functions that handle state updates. In our example, State is a TypedDict with one key: messages. The add_messages reducer function is used to append new messages to the list instead of overwriting it. Keys without a reducer annotation will overwrite previous values. Learn more about state, reducers, and related concepts in this guide.

Next, add a "chatbot" node. Nodes represent units of work. They are typically regular python functions.
from langchain_anthropic import ChatAnthropic

llm = ChatAnthropic(model="claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620")

def chatbot(state: State):
    return {"messages": [llm.invoke(state["messages"])]}

# The first argument is the unique node name
# The second argument is the function or object that will be called whenever
# the node is used.
graph_builder.add_node("chatbot", chatbot)

API Reference: ChatAnthropic
Notice how the chatbot node function takes the current State as input and returns a dictionary containing an updated messages list under the key "messages". This is the basic pattern for all LangGraph node functions.
The add_messages function in our State will append the llm's response messages to whatever messages are already in the state.
Next, add an entry point. This tells our graph where to start its work each time we run it.
graph_builder.add_edge(START, "chatbot")

Similarly, set a finish point. This instructs the graph "any time this node is run, you can exit."
graph_builder.add_edge("chatbot", END)

Finally, we'll want to be able to run our graph. To do so, call "compile()" on the graph builder. This creates a "CompiledGraph" we can use invoke on our state.
graph = graph_builder.compile()

You can visualize the graph using the get_graph method and one of the "draw" methods, like draw_ascii or draw_png. The draw methods each require additional dependencies.
from IPython.display import Image, display

try:
    display(Image(graph.get_graph().draw_mermaid_png()))
except Exception:
    # This requires some extra dependencies and is optional
    pass

Now let's run the chatbot! 
Tip: You can exit the chat loop at any time by typing "quit", "exit", or "q".
def stream_graph_updates(user_input: str):
    for event in graph.stream({"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": user_input}]}):
        for value in event.values():
            print("Assistant:", value["messages"][-1].content)

while True:
    try:
        user_input = input("User: ")
        if user_input.lower() in ["quit", "exit", "q"]:
            print("Goodbye!")
            break
        stream_graph_updates(user_input)
    except:
        # fallback if input() is not available
        user_input = "What do you know about LangGraph?"
        print("User: " + user_input)
        stream_graph_updates(user_input)
        break

Assistant: LangGraph is a library designed to help build stateful multi-agent applications using language models. It provides tools for creating workflows and state machines to coordinate multiple AI agents or language model interactions. LangGraph is built on top of LangChain, leveraging its components while adding graph-based coordination capabilities. It's particularly useful for developing more complex, stateful AI applications that go beyond simple query-response interactions.
Goodbye!

Congratulations! You've built your first chatbot using LangGraph. This bot can engage in basic conversation by taking user input and generating responses using an LLM. You can inspect a LangSmith Trace for the call above at the provided link.
However, you may have noticed that the bot's knowledge is limited to what's in its training data. In the next part, we'll add a web search tool to expand the bot's knowledge and make it more capable.
Below is the full code for this section for your reference:

Full Code

from typing import Annotated

from langchain_anthropic import ChatAnthropic
from typing_extensions import TypedDict

from langgraph.graph import StateGraph
from langgraph.graph.message import add_messages

class State(TypedDict):
    messages: Annotated[list, add_messages]

graph_builder = StateGraph(State)

llm = ChatAnthropic(model="claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620")

def chatbot(state: State):
    return {"messages": [llm.invoke(state["messages"])]}

# The first argument is the unique node name
# The second argument is the function or object that will be called whenever
# the node is used.
graph_builder.add_node("chatbot", chatbot)
graph_builder.set_entry_point("chatbot")
graph_builder.set_finish_point("chatbot")
graph = graph_builder.compile()

API Reference: ChatAnthropic | StateGraph | add_messages

Part 2: 🛠️ Enhancing the Chatbot with Tools¶
To handle queries our chatbot can't answer "from memory", we'll integrate a web search tool. Our bot can use this tool to find relevant information and provide better responses.
Requirements¶
Before we start, make sure you have the necessary packages installed and API keys set up:
First, install the requirements to use the Tavily Search Engine, and set your TAVILY_API_KEY.
%%capture --no-stderr
%pip install -U tavily-python langchain_community

_set_env("TAVILY_API_KEY")

TAVILY_API_KEY:  ········

Next, define the tool:
from langchain_community.tools.tavily_search import TavilySearchResults

tool = TavilySearchResults(max_results=2)
tools = [tool]
tool.invoke("What's a 'node' in LangGraph?")

API Reference: TavilySearchResults
[{'url': 'https://medium.com/@cplog/introduction-to-langgraph-a-beginners-guide-14f9be027141',
  'content': 'Nodes: Nodes are the building blocks of your LangGraph. Each node represents a function or a computation step. You define nodes to perform specific tasks, such as processing input, making ...'},
 {'url': 'https://saksheepatil05.medium.com/demystifying-langgraph-a-beginner-friendly-dive-into-langgraph-concepts-5ffe890ddac0',
  'content': 'Nodes (Tasks): Nodes are like the workstations on the assembly line. Each node performs a specific task on the product. In LangGraph, nodes are Python functions that take the current state, do some work, and return an updated state. Next, we define the nodes, each representing a task in our sandwich-making process.'}]

The results are page summaries our chat bot can use to answer questions.
Next, we'll start defining our graph. The following is all the same as in Part 1, except we have added bind_tools on our LLM. This lets the LLM know the correct JSON format to use if it wants to use our search engine.
from typing import Annotated

from langchain_anthropic import ChatAnthropic
from typing_extensions import TypedDict

from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END
from langgraph.graph.message import add_messages

class State(TypedDict):
    messages: Annotated[list, add_messages]

graph_builder = StateGraph(State)

llm = ChatAnthropic(model="claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620")
# Modification: tell the LLM which tools it can call
llm_with_tools = llm.bind_tools(tools)

def chatbot(state: State):
    return {"messages": [llm_with_tools.invoke(state["messages"])]}

graph_builder.add_node("chatbot", chatbot)

API Reference: ChatAnthropic | StateGraph | START | END | add_messages
Next we need to create a function to actually run the tools if they are called. We'll do this by adding the tools to a new node.
Below, we implement a BasicToolNode that checks the most recent message in the state and calls tools if the message contains tool_calls. It relies on the LLM's tool_calling support, which is available in Anthropic, OpenAI, Google Gemini, and a number of other LLM providers.
We will later replace this with LangGraph's prebuilt ToolNode to speed things up, but building it ourselves first is instructive.
import json

from langchain_core.messages import ToolMessage

class BasicToolNode:
    """A node that runs the tools requested in the last AIMessage."""

    def __init__(self, tools: list) -> None:
        self.tools_by_name = {tool.name: tool for tool in tools}

    def __call__(self, inputs: dict):
        if messages := inputs.get("messages", []):
            message = messages[-1]
        else:
            raise ValueError("No message found in input")
        outputs = []
        for tool_call in message.tool_calls:
            tool_result = self.tools_by_name[tool_call["name"]].invoke(
                tool_call["args"]
            )
            outputs.append(
                ToolMessage(
                    content=json.dumps(tool_result),
                    name=tool_call["name"],
                    tool_call_id=tool_call["id"],
                )
            )
        return {"messages": outputs}

tool_node = BasicToolNode(tools=[tool])
graph_builder.add_node("tools", tool_node)

API Reference: ToolMessage
With the tool node added, we can define the conditional_edges. 
Recall that edges route the control flow from one node to the next. Conditional edges usually contain "if" statements to route to different nodes depending on the current graph state. These functions receive the current graph state and return a string or list of strings indicating which node(s) to call next.
Below, call define a router function called route_tools, that checks for tool_calls in the chatbot's output. Provide this function to the graph by calling add_conditional_edges, which tells the graph that whenever the chatbot node completes to check this function to see where to go next. 
The condition will route to tools if tool calls are present and END if not.
Later, we will replace this with the prebuilt tools_condition to be more concise, but implementing it ourselves first makes things more clear. 
def route_tools(
    state: State,
):
    """
    Use in the conditional_edge to route to the ToolNode if the last message
    has tool calls. Otherwise, route to the end.
    """
    if isinstance(state, list):
        ai_message = state[-1]
    elif messages := state.get("messages", []):
        ai_message = messages[-1]
    else:
        raise ValueError(f"No messages found in input state to tool_edge: {state}")
    if hasattr(ai_message, "tool_calls") and len(ai_message.tool_calls) > 0:
        return "tools"
    return END

# The `tools_condition` function returns "tools" if the chatbot asks to use a tool, and "END" if
# it is fine directly responding. This conditional routing defines the main agent loop.
graph_builder.add_conditional_edges(
    "chatbot",
    route_tools,
    # The following dictionary lets you tell the graph to interpret the condition's outputs as a specific node
    # It defaults to the identity function, but if you
    # want to use a node named something else apart from "tools",
    # You can update the value of the dictionary to something else
    # e.g., "tools": "my_tools"
    {"tools": "tools", END: END},
)
# Any time a tool is called, we return to the chatbot to decide the next step
graph_builder.add_edge("tools", "chatbot")
graph_builder.add_edge(START, "chatbot")
graph = graph_builder.compile()

Notice that conditional edges start from a single node. This tells the graph "any time the 'chatbot' node runs, either go to 'tools' if it calls a tool, or end the loop if it responds directly. 
Like the prebuilt tools_condition, our function returns the END string if no tool calls are made. When the graph transitions to END, it has no more tasks to complete and ceases execution. Because the condition can return END, we don't need to explicitly set a finish_point this time. Our graph already has a way to finish!
Let's visualize the graph we've built. The following function has some additional dependencies to run that are unimportant for this tutorial.
from IPython.display import Image, display

try:
    display(Image(graph.get_graph().draw_mermaid_png()))
except Exception:
    # This requires some extra dependencies and is optional
    pass

Now we can ask the bot questions outside its training data.
while True:
    try:
        user_input = input("User: ")
        if user_input.lower() in ["quit", "exit", "q"]:
            print("Goodbye!")
            break

        stream_graph_updates(user_input)
    except:
        # fallback if input() is not available
        user_input = "What do you know about LangGraph?"
        print("User: " + user_input)
        stream_graph_updates(user_input)
        break

Goodbye!

Congrats! You've created a conversational agent in langgraph that can use a search engine to retrieve updated information when needed. Now it can handle a wider range of user queries. To inspect all the steps your agent just took, check out this LangSmith trace.
Our chatbot still can't remember past interactions on its own, limiting its ability to have coherent, multi-turn conversations. In the next part, we'll add memory to address this.
The full code for the graph we've created in this section is reproduced below, replacing our BasicToolNode for the prebuilt ToolNode, and our route_tools condition with the prebuilt tools_condition

Part 3: Adding Memory to the Chatbot¶
Our chatbot can now use tools to answer user questions, but it doesn't remember the context of previous interactions. This limits its ability to have coherent, multi-turn conversations.
LangGraph solves this problem through persistent checkpointing. If you provide a checkpointer when compiling the graph and a thread_id when calling your graph, LangGraph automatically saves the state after each step. When you invoke the graph again using the same thread_id, the graph loads its saved state, allowing the chatbot to pick up where it left off. 
We will see later that checkpointing is much more powerful than simple chat memory - it lets you save and resume complex state at any time for error recovery, human-in-the-loop workflows, time travel interactions, and more. But before we get too ahead of ourselves, let's add checkpointing to enable multi-turn conversations.
To get started, create a MemorySaver checkpointer.
from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver

memory = MemorySaver()

API Reference: MemorySaver
Notice we're using an in-memory checkpointer. This is convenient for our tutorial (it saves it all in-memory). In a production application, you would likely change this to use SqliteSaver or PostgresSaver and connect to your own DB.
Next define the graph. Now that you've already built your own BasicToolNode, we'll replace it with LangGraph's prebuilt ToolNode and tools_condition, since these do some nice things like parallel API execution. Apart from that, the following is all copied from Part 2.
from typing import Annotated

from langchain_anthropic import ChatAnthropic
from langchain_community.tools.tavily_search import TavilySearchResults
from langchain_core.messages import BaseMessage
from typing_extensions import TypedDict

from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END
from langgraph.graph.message import add_messages
from langgraph.prebuilt import ToolNode, tools_condition

class State(TypedDict):
    messages: Annotated[list, add_messages]

graph_builder = StateGraph(State)

tool = TavilySearchResults(max_results=2)
tools = [tool]
llm = ChatAnthropic(model="claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620")
llm_with_tools = llm.bind_tools(tools)

def chatbot(state: State):
    return {"messages": [llm_with_tools.invoke(state["messages"])]}

graph_builder.add_node("chatbot", chatbot)

tool_node = ToolNode(tools=[tool])
graph_builder.add_node("tools", tool_node)

graph_builder.add_conditional_edges(
    "chatbot",
    tools_condition,
)
# Any time a tool is called, we return to the chatbot to decide the next step
graph_builder.add_edge("tools", "chatbot")
graph_builder.add_edge(START, "chatbot")

API Reference: ChatAnthropic | TavilySearchResults | BaseMessage | StateGraph | START | END | add_messages | ToolNode | tools_condition
Finally, compile the graph with the provided checkpointer.
graph = graph_builder.compile(checkpointer=memory)

Notice the connectivity of the graph hasn't changed since Part 2. All we are doing is checkpointing the State as the graph works through each node.
from IPython.display import Image, display

try:
    display(Image(graph.get_graph().draw_mermaid_png()))
except Exception:
    # This requires some extra dependencies and is optional
    pass

Now you can interact with your bot! First, pick a thread to use as the key for this conversation.
config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "1"}}

Next, call your chat bot.
user_input = "Hi there! My name is Will."

# The config is the **second positional argument** to stream() or invoke()!
events = graph.stream(
    {"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": user_input}]},
    config,
    stream_mode="values",
)
for event in events:
    event["messages"][-1].pretty_print()

================================[1m Human Message [0m=================================

Hi there! My name is Will.
==================================[1m Ai Message [0m==================================

Hello Will! It's nice to meet you. How can I assist you today? Is there anything specific you'd like to know or discuss?

Note: The config was provided as the second positional argument when calling our graph. It importantly is not nested within the graph inputs ({'messages': []}).
Let's ask a followup: see if it remembers your name.
user_input = "Remember my name?"

# The config is the **second positional argument** to stream() or invoke()!
events = graph.stream(
    {"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": user_input}]},
    config,
    stream_mode="values",
)
for event in events:
    event["messages"][-1].pretty_print()

================================[1m Human Message [0m=================================

Remember my name?
==================================[1m Ai Message [0m==================================

Of course, I remember your name, Will. I always try to pay attention to important details that users share with me. Is there anything else you'd like to talk about or any questions you have? I'm here to help with a wide range of topics or tasks.

Notice that we aren't using an external list for memory: it's all handled by the checkpointer! You can inspect the full execution in this LangSmith trace to see what's going on.
Don't believe me? Try this using a different config.
# The only difference is we change the `thread_id` here to "2" instead of "1"
events = graph.stream(
    {"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": user_input}]},
    {"configurable": {"thread_id": "2"}},
    stream_mode="values",
)
for event in events:
    event["messages"][-1].pretty_print()

================================[1m Human Message [0m=================================

Remember my name?
==================================[1m Ai Message [0m==================================

I apologize, but I don't have any previous context or memory of your name. As an AI assistant, I don't retain information from past conversations. Each interaction starts fresh. Could you please tell me your name so I can address you properly in this conversation?

Notice that the only change we've made is to modify the thread_id in the config. See this call's LangSmith trace for comparison. 
By now, we have made a few checkpoints across two different threads. But what goes into a checkpoint? To inspect a graph's state for a given config at any time, call get_state(config).
snapshot = graph.get_state(config)

snapshot.next  # (since the graph ended this turn, `next` is empty. If you fetch a state from within a graph invocation, next tells which node will execute next)

()

The snapshot above contains the current state values, corresponding config, and the next node to process. In our case, the graph has reached an END state, so next is empty.
Congratulations! Your chatbot can now maintain conversation state across sessions thanks to LangGraph's checkpointing system. This opens up exciting possibilities for more natural, contextual interactions. LangGraph's checkpointing even handles arbitrarily complex graph states, which is much more expressive and powerful than simple chat memory.
In the next part, we'll introduce human oversight to our bot to handle situations where it may need guidance or verification before proceeding.
Check out the code snippet below to review our graph from this section.

Part 4: Human-in-the-loop¶
Agents can be unreliable and may need human input to successfully accomplish tasks. Similarly, for some actions, you may want to require human approval before running to ensure that everything is running as intended.
LangGraph's persistence layer supports human-in-the-loop workflows, allowing execution to pause and resume based on user feedback. The primary interface to this functionality is the interrupt function. Calling interrupt inside a node will pause execution. Execution can be resumed, together with new input from a human, by passing in a Command. interrupt is ergonomically similar to Python's built-in input(), with some caveats. We demonstrate an example below.
First, start with our existing code from Part 3. We will make one change, which is to add a simple human_assistance tool accessible to the chatbot. This tool uses interrupt to receive information from a human.
from typing import Annotated

from langchain_anthropic import ChatAnthropic
from langchain_community.tools.tavily_search import TavilySearchResults
from langchain_core.tools import tool
from typing_extensions import TypedDict

from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END
from langgraph.graph.message import add_messages
from langgraph.prebuilt import ToolNode, tools_condition

from langgraph.types import Command, interrupt

class State(TypedDict):
    messages: Annotated[list, add_messages]

graph_builder = StateGraph(State)

@tool
def human_assistance(query: str) -> str:
    """Request assistance from a human."""
    human_response = interrupt({"query": query})
    return human_response["data"]

tool = TavilySearchResults(max_results=2)
tools = [tool, human_assistance]
llm = ChatAnthropic(model="claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620")
llm_with_tools = llm.bind_tools(tools)

def chatbot(state: State):
    message = llm_with_tools.invoke(state["messages"])
    # Because we will be interrupting during tool execution,
    # we disable parallel tool calling to avoid repeating any
    # tool invocations when we resume.
    assert len(message.tool_calls) <= 1
    return {"messages": [message]}

graph_builder.add_node("chatbot", chatbot)

tool_node = ToolNode(tools=tools)
graph_builder.add_node("tools", tool_node)

graph_builder.add_conditional_edges(
    "chatbot",
    tools_condition,
)
graph_builder.add_edge("tools", "chatbot")
graph_builder.add_edge(START, "chatbot")

API Reference: ChatAnthropic | TavilySearchResults | tool | MemorySaver | StateGraph | START | END | add_messages | ToolNode | tools_condition | Command | interrupt

Tip
Check out the Human-in-the-loop section of the How-to Guides for more examples of Human-in-the-loop workflows, including how to review and edit tool calls before they are executed.

We compile the graph with a checkpointer, as before:
memory = MemorySaver()

graph = graph_builder.compile(checkpointer=memory)

Visualizing the graph, we recover the same layout as before. We have just added a tool!
from IPython.display import Image, display

try:
    display(Image(graph.get_graph().draw_mermaid_png()))
except Exception:
    # This requires some extra dependencies and is optional
    pass

Let's now prompt the chatbot with a question that will engage the new human_assistance tool:
user_input = "I need some expert guidance for building an AI agent. Could you request assistance for me?"
config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "1"}}

events = graph.stream(
    {"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": user_input}]},
    config,
    stream_mode="values",
)
for event in events:
    if "messages" in event:
        event["messages"][-1].pretty_print()

================================[1m Human Message [0m=================================

I need some expert guidance for building an AI agent. Could you request assistance for me?

  Args:

The chatbot generated a tool call, but then execution has been interrupted! Note that if we inspect the graph state, we see that it stopped at the tools node:
snapshot = graph.get_state(config)
snapshot.next

('tools',)

Let's take a closer look at the human_assistance tool:
@tool
def human_assistance(query: str) -> str:
    """Request assistance from a human."""
    human_response = interrupt({"query": query})
    return human_response["data"]

Similar to Python's built-in input() function, calling interrupt inside the tool will pause execution. Progress is persisted based on our choice of checkpointer-- so if we are persisting with Postgres, we can resume at any time as long as the database is alive. Here we are persisting with the in-memory checkpointer, so we can resume any time as long as our Python kernel is running.
To resume execution, we pass a Command object containing data expected by the tool. The format of this data can be customized based on our needs. Here, we just need a dict with a key "data":
human_response = (
    "We, the experts are here to help! We'd recommend you check out LangGraph to build your agent."
    " It's much more reliable and extensible than simple autonomous agents."
)

human_command = Command(resume={"data": human_response})

events = graph.stream(human_command, config, stream_mode="values")
for event in events:
    if "messages" in event:
        event["messages"][-1].pretty_print()

==================================[1m Ai Message [0m==================================

Thank you for your patience. I've received some expert advice regarding your request for guidance on building an AI agent. Here's what the experts have suggested:

The experts recommend that you look into LangGraph for building your AI agent. They mention that LangGraph is a more reliable and extensible option compared to simple autonomous agents.

LangGraph is likely a framework or library designed specifically for creating AI agents with advanced capabilities. Here are a few points to consider based on this recommendation:

1. Reliability: The experts emphasize that LangGraph is more reliable than simpler autonomous agent approaches. This could mean it has better stability, error handling, or consistent performance.

2. Extensibility: LangGraph is described as more extensible, which suggests that it probably offers a flexible architecture that allows you to easily add new features or modify existing ones as your agent's requirements evolve.

3. Advanced capabilities: Given that it's recommended over "simple autonomous agents," LangGraph likely provides more sophisticated tools and techniques for building complex AI agents.

To get started with LangGraph, you might want to:

1. Search for the official LangGraph documentation or website to learn more about its features and how to use it.
2. Look for tutorials or guides specifically focused on building AI agents with LangGraph.
3. Check if there are any community forums or discussion groups where you can ask questions and get support from other developers using LangGraph.

If you'd like more specific information about LangGraph or have any questions about this recommendation, please feel free to ask, and I can request further assistance from the experts.

Our input has been received and processed as a tool message. Review this call's LangSmith trace to see the exact work that was done in the above call. Notice that the state is loaded in the first step so that our chatbot can continue where it left off.
Congrats! You've used an interrupt to add human-in-the-loop execution to your chatbot, allowing for human oversight and intervention when needed. This opens up the potential UIs you can create with your AI systems. Since we have already added a checkpointer, as long as the underlying persistence layer is running, the graph can be paused indefinitely and resumed at any time as if nothing had happened.
Human-in-the-loop workflows enable a variety of new workflows and user experiences. Check out this section of the How-to Guides for more examples of Human-in-the-loop workflows, including how to review and edit tool calls before they are executed.

Part 5: Customizing State¶
So far, we've relied on a simple state with one entry-- a list of messages. You can go far with this simple state, but if you want to define complex behavior without relying on the message list, you can add additional fields to the state. Here we will demonstrate a new scenario, in which the chatbot is using its search tool to find specific information, and forwarding them to a human for review. Let's have the chatbot research the birthday of an entity. We will add name and birthday keys to the state:
from typing import Annotated

from typing_extensions import TypedDict

from langgraph.graph.message import add_messages

class State(TypedDict):
    messages: Annotated[list, add_messages]
    name: str
    birthday: str

API Reference: add_messages
Adding this information to the state makes it easily accessible by other graph nodes (e.g., a downstream node that stores or processes the information), as well as the graph's persistence layer.
Here, we will populate the state keys inside of our human_assistance tool. This allows a human to review the information before it is stored in the state. We will again use Command, this time to issue a state update from inside our tool. Read more about use cases for Command here.
from langchain_core.messages import ToolMessage
from langchain_core.tools import InjectedToolCallId, tool

from langgraph.types import Command, interrupt

@tool
# Note that because we are generating a ToolMessage for a state update, we
# generally require the ID of the corresponding tool call. We can use
# LangChain's InjectedToolCallId to signal that this argument should not
# be revealed to the model in the tool's schema.
def human_assistance(
    name: str, birthday: str, tool_call_id: Annotated[str, InjectedToolCallId]
) -> str:
    """Request assistance from a human."""
    human_response = interrupt(
        {
            "question": "Is this correct?",
            "name": name,
            "birthday": birthday,
        },
    )
    # If the information is correct, update the state as-is.
    if human_response.get("correct", "").lower().startswith("y"):
        verified_name = name
        verified_birthday = birthday
        response = "Correct"
    # Otherwise, receive information from the human reviewer.
    else:
        verified_name = human_response.get("name", name)
        verified_birthday = human_response.get("birthday", birthday)
        response = f"Made a correction: {human_response}"

    # This time we explicitly update the state with a ToolMessage inside
    # the tool.
    state_update = {
        "name": verified_name,
        "birthday": verified_birthday,
        "messages": [ToolMessage(response, tool_call_id=tool_call_id)],
    }
    # We return a Command object in the tool to update our state.
    return Command(update=state_update)

Otherwise, the rest of our graph is the same:

    assert len(message.tool_calls) <= 1
    return {"messages": [message]}

Let's prompt our application to look up the "birthday" of the LangGraph library. We will direct the chatbot to reach out to the human_assistance tool once it has the required information. Note that setting name and birthday in the arguments for the tool, we force the chatbot to generate proposals for these fields.

    "Can you look up when LangGraph was released? "
    "When you have the answer, use the human_assistance tool for review."

Made a correction: {'name': 'LangGraph', 'birthday': 'Jan 17, 2024'}
==================================[1m Ai Message [0m==================================

Thank you for the human assistance. I can now provide you with the correct information about LangGraph's release date.

LangGraph was initially released on January 17, 2024. This information comes from the human assistance correction, which is more accurate than the search results I initially found.

To summarize:
1. LangGraph's original release date: January 17, 2024
2. LangGraph Cloud announcement: June 27, 2024

It's worth noting that LangGraph had been in development and use for some time before the LangGraph Cloud announcement, but the official initial release of LangGraph itself was on January 17, 2024.

Note that these fields are now reflected in the state:
snapshot = graph.get_state(config)

{k: v for k, v in snapshot.values.items() if k in ("name", "birthday")}

{'name': 'LangGraph', 'birthday': 'Jan 17, 2024'}

This makes them easily accessible to downstream nodes (e.g., a node that further processes or stores the information).
Manually updating state¶
LangGraph gives a high degree of control over the application state. For instance, at any point (including when interrupted), we can manually override a key using graph.update_state:
graph.update_state(config, {"name": "LangGraph (library)"})

{'configurable': {'thread_id': '1',
  'checkpoint_ns': '',
  'checkpoint_id': '1efd4ec5-cf69-6352-8006-9278f1730162'}}

If we call graph.get_state, we can see the new value is reflected:
snapshot = graph.get_state(config)

{k: v for k, v in snapshot.values.items() if k in ("name", "birthday")}

{'name': 'LangGraph (library)', 'birthday': 'Jan 17, 2024'}

Manual state updates will even generate a trace in LangSmith. If desired, they can also be used to control human-in-the-loop workflows, as described in this guide. Use of the interrupt function is generally recommended instead, as it allows data to be transmitted in a human-in-the-loop interaction independently of state updates.
Congratulations! You've added custom keys to the state to facilitate a more complex workflow, and learned how to generate state updates from inside tools.
We're almost done with the tutorial, but there is one more concept we'd like to review before finishing that connects checkpointing and state updates. 
This section's code is reproduced below for your reference.

Part 6: Time Travel¶
In a typical chat bot workflow, the user interacts with the bot 1 or more times to accomplish a task. In the previous sections, we saw how to add memory and a human-in-the-loop to be able to checkpoint our graph state and control future responses.
But what if you want to let your user start from a previous response and "branch off" to explore a separate outcome? Or what if you want users to be able to "rewind" your assistant's work to fix some mistakes or try a different strategy (common in applications like autonomous software engineers)?
You can create both of these experiences and more using LangGraph's built-in "time travel" functionality. 
In this section, you will "rewind" your graph by fetching a checkpoint using the graph's get_state_history method. You can then resume execution at this previous point in time.
For this, let's use the simple chatbot with tools from Part 3:
from typing import Annotated

from langchain_anthropic import ChatAnthropic
from langchain_community.tools.tavily_search import TavilySearchResults
from langchain_core.messages import BaseMessage
from typing_extensions import TypedDict

from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END
from langgraph.graph.message import add_messages
from langgraph.prebuilt import ToolNode, tools_condition

class State(TypedDict):
    messages: Annotated[list, add_messages]

graph_builder = StateGraph(State)

tool = TavilySearchResults(max_results=2)
tools = [tool]
llm = ChatAnthropic(model="claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620")
llm_with_tools = llm.bind_tools(tools)

def chatbot(state: State):
    return {"messages": [llm_with_tools.invoke(state["messages"])]}

graph_builder.add_node("chatbot", chatbot)

tool_node = ToolNode(tools=[tool])
graph_builder.add_node("tools", tool_node)

graph_builder.add_conditional_edges(
    "chatbot",
    tools_condition,
)
graph_builder.add_edge("tools", "chatbot")
graph_builder.add_edge(START, "chatbot")

memory = MemorySaver()
graph = graph_builder.compile(checkpointer=memory)

API Reference: ChatAnthropic | TavilySearchResults | BaseMessage | MemorySaver | StateGraph | START | END | add_messages | ToolNode | tools_condition
Let's have our graph take a couple steps. Every step will be checkpointed in its state history:
config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "1"}}
events = graph.stream(
    {
        "messages": [
            {
                "role": "user",

Great idea! Building an autonomous agent with LangGraph is definitely an exciting project. Based on the latest information I've found, here are some insights and tips for building autonomous agents with LangGraph:

1. Multi-Tool Agents: LangGraph is particularly well-suited for creating autonomous agents that can use multiple tools. This allows your agent to have a diverse set of capabilities and choose the right tool for each task.

2. Integration with Large Language Models (LLMs): You can combine LangGraph with powerful LLMs like Gemini 2.0 to create more intelligent and capable agents. The LLM can serve as the "brain" of your agent, making decisions and generating responses.

3. Workflow Management: LangGraph excels at managing complex, multi-step AI workflows. This is crucial for autonomous agents that need to break down tasks into smaller steps and execute them in the right order.

4. Practical Tutorials Available: There are tutorials available that provide full code examples for building and running multi-tool agents. These can be incredibly helpful as you start your project.

5. Langchain Integration: LangGraph is often used in conjunction with Langchain. This combination provides a powerful framework for building AI agents, offering features like memory management, tool integration, and prompt management.

6. GitHub Resources: There are repositories available (like the one by anmolaman20) that provide comprehensive resources for building AI agents using Langchain and LangGraph. These can be valuable references as you develop your agent.

7. Real-time Adaptation: LangGraph allows you to create agents that can think, reason, and adapt in real-time, which is crucial for truly autonomous behavior.

8. Customization: You can equip your agent with specific tools tailored to your use case. For example, you might include tools for web searching, data analysis, or interacting with specific APIs.

To get started with your autonomous agent project:

1. Familiarize yourself with LangGraph's documentation and basic concepts.
2. Look into tutorials that specifically deal with building autonomous agents, like the one mentioned from Towards Data Science.
3. Decide on the specific capabilities you want your agent to have and identify the tools it will need.
4. Start with a simple agent and gradually add complexity as you become more comfortable with the framework.
5. Experiment with different LLMs to find the one that works best for your use case.
6. Pay attention to how you structure the agent's decision-making process and workflow.
7. Don't forget to implement proper error handling and safety measures, especially if your agent will be interacting with external systems or making important decisions.

Building an autonomous agent is an iterative process, so be prepared to refine and improve your agent over time. Good luck with your project! If you need any more specific information as you progress, feel free to ask.

Now that we've had the agent take a couple steps, we can replay the full state history to see everything that occurred.
to_replay = None
for state in graph.get_state_history(config):
    print("Num Messages: ", len(state.values["messages"]), "Next: ", state.next)
    print("-" * 80)
    if len(state.values["messages"]) == 6:
        # We are somewhat arbitrarily selecting a specific state based on the number of chat messages in the state.
        to_replay = state

Num Messages:  8 Next:  ()
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Num Messages:  7 Next:  ('chatbot',)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Num Messages:  6 Next:  ('tools',)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Num Messages:  5 Next:  ('chatbot',)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Num Messages:  4 Next:  ('__start__',)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Num Messages:  4 Next:  ()
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Num Messages:  3 Next:  ('chatbot',)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Num Messages:  2 Next:  ('tools',)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Num Messages:  1 Next:  ('chatbot',)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Num Messages:  0 Next:  ('__start__',)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Notice that checkpoints are saved for every step of the graph. This spans invocations so you can rewind across a full thread's history. We've picked out to_replay as a state to resume from. This is the state after the chatbot node in the second graph invocation above.
Resuming from this point should call the action node next.
print(to_replay.next)
print(to_replay.config)

('tools',)
{'configurable': {'thread_id': '1', 'checkpoint_ns': '', 'checkpoint_id': '1efd43e3-0c1f-6c4e-8006-891877d65740'}}

Notice that the checkpoint's config (to_replay.config) contains a checkpoint_id timestamp. Providing this checkpoint_id value tells LangGraph's checkpointer to load the state from that moment in time. Let's try it below:
# The `checkpoint_id` in the `to_replay.config` corresponds to a state we've persisted to our checkpointer.
for event in graph.stream(None, to_replay.config, stream_mode="values"):
    if "messages" in event:
        event["messages"][-1].pretty_print()

CONTENT:
Quickstart: Launch Local LangGraph Server¶
This is a quick start guide to help you get a LangGraph app up and running locally.

Requirements

Python >= 3.11
LangGraph CLI: Requires langchain-cli[inmem] >= 0.1.58

Install the LangGraph CLI¶
pip install --upgrade "langgraph-cli[inmem]"

🌱 Create a LangGraph App¶
Create a new app from the react-agent template. This template is a simple agent that can be flexibly extended to many tools.
Python ServerNode Server

langgraph new path/to/your/app --template react-agent-python 

langgraph new path/to/your/app --template react-agent-js

Additional Templates
If you use langgraph new without specifying a template, you will be presented with an interactive menu that will allow you to choose from a list of available templates.

Install Dependencies¶
In the root of your new LangGraph app, install the dependencies in edit mode so your local changes are used by the server:
pip install -e .

Create a .env file¶
You will find a .env.example in the root of your new LangGraph app. Create
a .env file in the root of your new LangGraph app and copy the contents of the .env.example file into it, filling in the necessary API keys:
LANGSMITH_API_KEY=lsv2...
TAVILY_API_KEY=tvly-...
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...

Get API Keys

LANGSMITH_API_KEY: Go to the LangSmith Settings page. Then clck Create API Key.
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: Get an API key from Anthropic.
OPENAI_API_KEY: Get an API key from OpenAI.
TAVILY_API_KEY: Get an API key on the Tavily website.

🚀 Launch LangGraph Server¶
langgraph dev

This will start up the LangGraph API server locally. If this runs successfully, you should see something like:

Ready!

API: http://localhost:2024

Docs: http://localhost:2024/docs

LangGraph Studio Web UI: https://smith.langchain.com/studio/?baseUrl=http://127.0.0.1:2024

In-Memory Mode
The langgraph dev command starts LangGraph Server in an in-memory mode. This mode is suitable for development and testing purposes. For production use, you should deploy LangGraph Server with access to a persistent storage backend.
If you want to test your application with a persistent storage backend, you can use the langgraph up command instead of langgraph dev. You will
need to have docker installed on your machine to use this command.

LangGraph Studio Web UI¶
LangGraph Studio Web is a specialized UI that you can connect to LangGraph API server to enable visualization, interaction, and debugging of your application locally. Test your graph in the LangGraph Studio Web UI by visiting the URL provided in the output of the langgraph dev command.

LangGraph Studio Web UI: https://smith.langchain.com/studio/?baseUrl=http://127.0.0.1:2024

Connecting to a server with a custom host/port
If you are running the LangGraph API server with a custom host / port, you can point the Studio Web UI at it by changing the baseUrl URL param. For example, if you are running your server on port 8000, you can change the above URL to the following:
https://smith.langchain.com/studio/baseUrl=http://127.0.0.1:8000

Safari Compatibility
Currently, LangGraph Studio Web does not support Safari when running a server locally.

Test the API¶
Python SDK (Async)Python SDK (Sync)Javascript SDKRest API

Install the LangGraph Python SDK
pip install langgraph-sdk

Send a message to the assistant (threadless run)
from langgraph_sdk import get_client

client = get_client(url="http://localhost:2024")

async for chunk in client.runs.stream(
    None,  # Threadless run
    "agent", # Name of assistant. Defined in langgraph.json.
    input={
        "messages": [{
            "role": "human",
            "content": "What is LangGraph?",
        }],
    },
    stream_mode="updates",
):
    print(f"Receiving new event of type: {chunk.event}...")
    print(chunk.data)
    print("\n\n")

Install the LangGraph Python SDK
pip install langgraph-sdk

Send a message to the assistant (threadless run)
from langgraph_sdk import get_sync_client

client = get_sync_client(url="http://localhost:2024")

for chunk in client.runs.stream(
    None,  # Threadless run
    "agent", # Name of assistant. Defined in langgraph.json.
    input={
        "messages": [{
            "role": "human",
            "content": "What is LangGraph?",
        }],
    },
    stream_mode="updates",
):
    print(f"Receiving new event of type: {chunk.event}...")
    print(chunk.data)
    print("\n\n")

Install the LangGraph JS SDK
npm install @langchain/langgraph-sdk

Send a message to the assistant (threadless run)
const { Client } = await import("@langchain/langgraph-sdk");

// only set the apiUrl if you changed the default port when calling langgraph dev
const client = new Client({ apiUrl: "http://localhost:2024"});

const streamResponse = client.runs.stream(
    null, // Threadless run
    "agent", // Assistant ID
    {
        input: {
            "messages": [
                { "role": "user", "content": "What is LangGraph?"}
            ]
        },
        streamMode: "messages",
    }
);

for await (const chunk of streamResponse) {
    console.log(`Receiving new event of type: ${chunk.event}...`);
    console.log(JSON.stringify(chunk.data));
    console.log("\n\n");
}

curl -s --request POST \
    --url "http://localhost:2024/runs/stream" \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --data "{
        \"assistant_id\": \"agent\",
        \"input\": {
            \"messages\": [
                {
                    \"role\": \"human\",
                    \"content\": \"What is LangGraph?\"
                }
            ]
        },
        \"stream_mode\": \"updates\"
    }" 

Auth
If you're connecting to a remote server, you will need to provide a LangSmith
API Key for authorization. Please see the API Reference for the clients
for more information.
